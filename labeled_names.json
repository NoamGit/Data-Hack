This is all driven by PG&E's recent move to \nfix prices for upwards of 1,000 MW's.  The pressure will be on SDG&E and SCE \nto do likewise.\n\n I will be in Portland on Monday and hope to get some time with you to \ndiscuss this but wanted to provide you with a preview.\n\nJeff and I discussed some structures that might be attractive to Sempra given \nthe regulatory and shareholder risk they face should they (1) continue to buy \npower at market prices and/or (2) lock in a fixed price: \n(a) costless collar,\n(b) fixed price coupled with writing long-dated puts, and \n(c) price cap.\n\nThese structures are intended to address Sempra's risk exposure.  Our \nunderlying understanding is:\n1)  Continued purchases @ market exposes Sempra to substantial regulatory and \nshareholder risk,\n2)  Fixing the price mitigates both of these risks,\n3)  A costless collar arguably keeps Sempra in the market limiting their \nexposure to higher prices but allowing them to benefit from lower prices,\n4)  Writing the put generates a premium which can be applied to lower a fixed \nprice, and\n5)  Holding a call eliminates their exposure to high prices and allows them \nto benefit from lower prices.\n\nWith that said, I expect the cost of the call to be huge.  However, the \ncostless collar and fixed price with a put could be attractive.  The only \nproblem with collars is that our bid-offer spread typically skews the band \nsuch that if the underlying price were $50, a cap with a $70 strike would be \nassociated with a $40 strike on the put.\n\nOur thought was to get some notional prices and but together a few plots to \nillustrate how these products work.\n \nWhat do you think?\n\nLaird\n\n", "label": true}, {"total_time": 1159920.0, "content": "Well, it's upon us again and that means X-Mas party.

A new  total return equity \nswap on EOG stock will need to be executed between ENA and Rabo.

Do we want cross default and \nCredit Event Upon Merger to apply to the parties?   Do we want to \nadd/eliminate additional events of default?

This is all driven by PG&E's recent move to \nfix prices for upwards of 1,000 MW's.  The pressure will be on SDG&E and SCE \nto do likewise.\n\n I will be in Portland on Monday and hope to get some time with you to \ndiscuss this but wanted to provide you with a preview.\n\nJeff and I discussed some structures that might be attractive to Sempra given \nthe regulatory and shareholder risk they face should they (1) continue to buy \npower at market prices and/or (2) lock in a fixed price: \n(a) costless collar,\n(b) fixed price coupled with writing long-dated puts, and \n(c) price cap.\n\nThese structures are intended to address Sempra's risk exposure.  Our \nunderlying understanding is:\n1)  Continued purchases @ market exposes Sempra to substantial regulatory and \nshareholder risk,\n2)  Fixing the price mitigates both of these risks,\n3)  A costless collar arguably keeps Sempra in the market limiting their \nexposure to higher prices but allowing them to benefit from lower prices,\n4)  Writing the put generates a premium which can be applied to lower a fixed \nprice, and\n5)  Holding a call eliminates their exposure to high prices and allows them \nto benefit from lower prices.\n\nWith that said, I expect the cost of the call to be huge.  However, the \ncostless collar and fixed price with a put could be attractive.  The only \nproblem with collars is that our bid-offer spread typically skews the band \nsuch that if the underlying price were $50, a cap with a $70 strike would be \nassociated with a $40 strike on the put.\n\nOur thought was to get some notional prices and but together a few plots to \nillustrate how these products work.\n \nWhat do you think?\n\nLaird\n\n", "label": true}, {"total_time": -24960.0, "content": "Little bird tells me that I may be lunching with you two at the 4 seasons ", "label": true}, {"total_time": -24420.0, "content": "The Assembly passed the budget late last night.", "label": true}, {"total_time": -25200.0, "content": "FYI.

So from that perspective, the choi=\nce=20\nto go with the TURN/muni settlement and embrace the status quo does no harm=\n. =20\nIt does considerable harm, however, when compared to the significant value=\n=20\nthat would have been created if the judge adopted the the unbundling=20\nsettlement.\n\nWe have a chance to go on the record in a trade publication \"California=20\nEnergy Markets.\"  Recent events might persuade us to keep a low profile=20\ngenerally at this point.

In opposition, muni generators and TURN=\n=20\nsupported SoCalGas' original proposal to essentially maintain the status qu=\no=20\n(SoCalGas eventually came over to our side, as did Southern California=20\nEdison). =20\n\nA judge's proposed decision came out the day before Thanksgiving adopting t=\nhe=20\nsettlement advocated by the muni generators and TURN. =20\n\nIf it weren't for the continual barrage of retrograde policy pronouncements=\n=20\ncoming from the \"new\" California PUC, folks would be genuinely shocked by t=\nhe=20\njudge's proposed decision, but as things are, it was somewhat expected.\n\nThere's one silver lining:  We managed to get in both settlements an=20\nidentical provision that eliminates a substantial amount of financial risk =\nTW=20\nwould have faced but for the provision.  So from that perspective, the choi=\nce=20\nto go with the TURN/muni settlement and embrace the status quo does no harm=\n. =20\nIt does considerable harm, however, when compared to the significant value=\n=20\nthat would have been created if the judge adopted the the unbundling=20\nsettlement.\n\nWe have a chance to go on the record in a trade publication \"California=20\nEnergy Markets.\"  Recent events might persuade us to keep a low profile=20\ngenerally at this point.  On the other hand, perhaps the time is right to=\n=20\nstart coming out of our corner just a bit and pointing out the very poor jo=\nb=20\nthis Commission is doing in managing California's energy policy.

Questar Corporation, et \nal/Third-party subpoenas\n\nMike and Andy,\n\nAndy, I tried to send this message to Richard as well, but the computer \ndirectory is fouled up and won't let me do it.  I hope sending it to you is \nsufficient, but if not, let me know.\n\nI received a call from Mike Noone of Mike Beatty & Associates about the \nabove-referenced lawsuit, which is filed in state court in Garfield County, \nColorado.  For Andy's reference, Beatty & Associates is representing the \nEnron entities and a number of other defendants in the Grynberg MDL case.  \nThis case is not a gas measurement case, which is the gist of the Grynberg \naction.\n\nNoone's firm represents the plaintiff; I did not ask who represents the \ndefendants, all of whom are Questar entities.  The lawsuit arises out of a \npartnerhip agreement to build the Transcolorado Pipeline.  The Transcolorado \nPipeline takes gas from Colorado producers at its northern end to an \ninterconnect (or interconnects) at its southern end to either El Paso or TW, \nwho deliver the gas to California markets.  After it was built, Questar \nallegedly began building a competing pipeline, called the Main Line 104 \nProject (the designation used in the FERC filings), which will connect \nQuestar's gathering system at the northern end of the pipeline to the Kern \nRiver Pipeline.  Kern River will apparently ultimately deliver the gas to \nCalifornia markets.  KN contends that the Main Line 104 Project will take gas \nfrom exactly the same basins as the Transcolorado Pipeline (the Picence and \nUlenta Basins, if I have that spelled correctly) and is in direct \ncompetition.  I did not ask Mike what relief KN is requesting.\n\nKN is interested in documentation from TW and ENA that discusses what their \ncompetitive options are in getting gas from the area served by the \nTranscolorado Pipeline to California markets.  It appears that KN is hoping \nto see some discussion of the Main Line 104 Project as an alternative to the \nTranscolorado Pipeline.  It strikes me that such information may be highly \nsensitive.\n\nI asked Mike why he thought ENA would have any such information, and Mike \nsaid that he thought ENA might own or have an interest in some producing \nproperties in the relevant area.  I told Mike that that would be a surprise \nto me, and that EOG, which is the Enron entity that typically owns such \ninterests, was spun off last year.  Mike said he would take another look to \nsee why they thought ENA would have such information.\n\nThe trial date is one year out, and this is apparently the first round of \ndiscovery.  Mike would not be surprised if we got a call from Questar's \nattorneys, requesting the same information.\n\nNoone faxed to me the proposed subpoenas, with the understanding that I was \nnot authorized to accept service for them.  I will send copies to each of \nyou.

In order to reduce Enron's non-market risks ( e.g. legal, credit \nand regulatory) in the volatile commodity markets in California or any \" \nfuture California\", we propose the following changes:\n\n1.    Mandatory Uniform Set-Off Provisions in All Trading Contracts for All \nCommodities -- set-off language varies commodity by commodity in trading \ncontracts.  Set-off is one of the most critical tools available to Enron in a \nmajor default situation and it is critical to have set-off language and to \nhave it be uniform commodity to commodity so that Enron can get the best \nadvantage from set-off and not just the least common denominator.\n\n2.

Merge EPMI into ENA -- power trades are done through EPMI.  Merging \nEPMI into ENA and conducting power trades through ENA is much more efficient \nfrom both a credit and legal point of view.\n\n4.     No Automatic Termination for a Bankruptcy Event -- in the PGE/SCE \nsituation, it should be the non-defaulting party's (Enron in this case) \noption to terminate rather than an automatic termination on \"inability to pay \ndebts as they become due\".\n\nLet me know if you have any other proposed changes to our trading contracts \nor entities through which we conduct our trading.

that Equilon's management would like to pursue a deal with us on an \nexclusive basis and that this decision is being forwarded to the Equilon \nBoard for approval.  If this acquisition goes forward, we will need to get \norganized---in the near term---on a number of logistical/due diligence tasks, \nbut one thing we should start thinking about now is the \"disclosure\" issue.\n\nIf the Equilon Board gives the go-ahead for Equilon to pursue this \ntransaction , Equilon will probably want  to sign a memorandum of \nunderstanding with us, and this may put us in a \"disclosure\" posture because \nat that point, we would be looking at a $65 million deal (approx.) with a \nclosure probability of no less than 20% (in my judgment, based upon our past \ndealings with these people).  Even without a signed document, the \n\"size/probability\" test would still be an issue for us to deal with.  \nEveryone should be thinking about this issue as we await word from Equilon's \nBoard.

So from that perspective, the choi=\nce=20\nto go with the TURN/muni settlement and embrace the status quo does no harm=\n. =20\nIt does considerable harm, however, when compared to the significant value=\n=20\nthat would have been created if the judge adopted the the unbundling=20\nsettlement.\n\nWe have a chance to go on the record in a trade publication \"California=20\nEnergy Markets.\"  Recent events might persuade us to keep a low profile=20\ngenerally at this point.  On the other hand, perhaps the time is right to=\n=20\nstart coming out of our corner just a bit and pointing out the very poor jo=\nb=20\nthis Commission is doing in managing California's energy policy.  I'm=20\nsquarely on the fence at this point and am seeking feedback.  A proposed=20\ncomment is attached. =20\n\nTwo questions:\n\n1) Do folks think that there's value in providing a comment?\n\n2) If so, does this statement work, or do folks have suggestions?\n\nThanks,\nJeff\n\n\"The California Public Utilities Commission has a choice. It can adopt the=\n=20\nsame, common sense natural gas policy for Southern California that=01,s bee=\nn in=20\nplace and working well for consumers in PG&E=01,s service territory.  Or it=\n=20\nstick with the status quo, which the industry agrees is at least partially=\n=20\nresponsible for bottlenecks and high prices in California.  The proposed=20\ndecision opts for the status quo.  That's not going to California=01,s natu=\nral=20\ngas problems and it=01,s likely to make matters worse in California's elect=\nric=20\nindustry.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "label": true}, {"total_time": 737640.0, "content": "Thanks, I also need to get some time with Shawn Cumberland... please schedule ", "label": false}, {"total_time": -28740.0, "content": "Like the closing line.
