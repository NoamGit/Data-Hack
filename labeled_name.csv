John,

You might recall we spoke a few weeks ago about a system with more 
intelligence for out-of-hours trading than just leaving the products on Last 
Trade is Mid.

Attached is a suggestion for how such a system might work. It builds on 
Offset to Last Trade functionality.

The simplified description is: It tracks two variables: Intensity(Speed) and 
Bias (Buy or Sell emphasis).  As Intensity increases, the Spread increases. 
As Bias increases, the Offset increases.

I'll call later to see what you think of the idea.

Dave

 

Program Criteria

The formula which defines the trading decision-making program will need to 
work with several criteria/inputs/definitions. These might be:

Intensity (Speed) - The average time between transaction attempts, regardless 
of whether they are buys or sells. Measured as a moving average over the last 
[Intensity Factor] transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction 
Tibco messages for the Product.
Obviously, the lower the Intensity calculation, the higher the transaction 
flow. Therefore a high Intensity number indicates low transaction flow.
Intensity Factor - The number of transactions to be included in the moving 
average Intensity calculation. A possible value for this might be [4].
#Buys - The number of Buys which have occurred.
#Sells - The number of Sells which have occured.
Transaction Count - Could be either #Buys or #Sells (whichever last occured).}
Buy Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Buy occurs.
Sell Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Sell occurs.
Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR)- The amount by which the Buy Offset should be 
reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount Sell Offset should be reduced if a Buy 
occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the 
ORR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be 1.
Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR)- The amount by which #Buys should be 
reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount #Sells should be reduced if a Buy 
occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the 
TRR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be equal 
to 1.
Spread Minimum - The minimum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this 
might be [0.04]
Spread Maximum - The maximum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this 
might be [0.50]
Offset Minimum - The minimum Offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A 
possible value for this might be [0].
Offset Maximum -The maximum offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A 
possible value for this might be [0.50]
Initial Offset - The Buy and Sell Offset used when the program is started
Initial Spread - The Spread used when the program is started
Spread-Offset Minimum - The minimum amount by which Spread must exceed 
Offset. Prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer. A 
possible value for this might be [0.01]
Dead Interval - The period of time which must pass before the program will 
recalculate the above Criteria, if no transactions have taken place during 
the Dead Interval. A possible value for this might be [240] seconds.

Program Outputs

The program should output the following variables as a result of combining 
the above Criteria in a user-defined Formula:

Spread (integer) - as per current Stack Manager
Offset (integer) - as per current Stack Manager
Suspension (boolean) - Whether or not the Product should be suspended. 
Normally ""False""


Program Interface and Operation Principles

The user should be provided with a GUI which will allow them to define a 
relationship among the above Criteria, which will produce and apply the 
Outputs to a particular Product. This relationship would be defined with 
Intensity Formulas and Transaction Formulas. 

Every time a Transaction occurs, or a Dead Interval passes, the Criteria will 
be recalculated and the user-defined formulas will be reviewed by the 
program. If a Dead Interval passes without any transactions taking place, 
then Intensity = Intensity +240 and #Buys=#Buys-TRR and #Sells=#Sells-TRR and 
Buy Offset = Buy Offset- ORR and Sell Offset = Sell Offset - ORR. 

If the user-defined Formulas (see following) indicate that a change in spread 
should occur, then if the Offset is zero (in the case of a trade occurring) 
or if no trade has occured (during the passing of a Dead Interval), the 
system shall perform a Last Trade is Mid calculation around the last 
transaction, adjusting the buy and sell prices according to the new Spread 
value.

Any adjustment to the Spread shall respect the Spread-Offset Minimum. If a 
reduction in the Spread should violate the Spread-Offset Minimum, then the 
Buy Offset (or Sell Offset, or both as appropriate) shall be reduced 
accordingly. Similarly, if the Offset is increased by a Transaction Formula 
to a level greater than the Spread, the Spread shall be increased to maintain 
the Spread-Offset Minimum.

GUI/Formulas Example:

Constants
Intensity Factor: [4]
Dead Interval: [240]
Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR): [0.3]
Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR): [0.3]
Spread Minimum [0.04]
Spread Maximum [0.50]
Offset Minimum [0]
Offset Maximum [0.49]
Spread-Offset Minimum [0.01]

         INPUTS           OUTPUTS
Intensity Formula
Formula # Intensity   Spread Offset  Suspension
S1  >220   -0.01 n/a F
S2  <30   +0.01 n/a F
S3  <10   +0.02 n/a F

Transaction Formula
Formula # # Transactions  Spread Offset  Suspension
V1  <4   n/a -0.01 F
V2  >3   n/a +0.01 F
V3  >5   +0.01 +0.02 F
V4  >10   +0.02 +0.04 F
V5  >15   +0.04 +0.15 F
V6  >20   n/a n/a T
    
Note that #Transactions would be #Buys or #Sells, as appropriate. Note also 
that #Buys and #Sells are not intended to be an absolute count, but rather 
are a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently 
occured.

In this example, all Constants and Formulae are editable by the user through 
the GUI.


Simulation

Obviously, if we want to proceed, we will want to conduct several simulations 
to prove concepts and evaluate responsiveness. However, to give some idea of 
how the above might work when a market starts to run in a particular 
direction, please see the attached:




Additional Features

System Notifications

There should be two kinds of notifications for the Robotrader, which will be 
similar to Stack Manager Garbage Checks: Warning and Failure levels for both 
Offset and Price. The warning levels will trigger a pager message. The 
Failure levels will trigger a pager message and the product will be 
automatically suspended. The Price checks will be against prices input by the 
trader (not relative price movements, but actual price). There should be both 
maximum and minimum price checks (e.g. gas is trading at $5.50. The 
notification levels could be $8 at the top end and $2 at the bottom end). 
Offset checks will only be against a maximum value.

1- The above spreadsheet looks at HO-NG seasonally. It gives perspective on 
'normal relationships'. 

Things I need to clarify about your ng view
1- As gas plummets are you assuming that it regains all demand (industrial 
shutdowns and fuel switchers)?
2-What is your outlook for Nov-Mar 01 and Ap-oct 02
3- How does your view change with a normal, cold or warm winter ?
4- Is your view predicated on getting to 2.6  is easy and that world did not 
end this past winter a storage level of 2.6?
5- Do you believe that we will need to price some demand out again this 
winter?

Sarah,

Thanks to you and Jennifer for arranging.   I will be in attendance at 3:00 
pm and have asked either Jim Crowder or Everett Plante to also attend.   I do 
not know their availability yet due to the Enron PRC meeting conflicts.   Is 
it possible for me to attend starting at 1:00 pm - I have not been through a

thanks again for your help.

Hi Kim,

Hope you had a great Thanksgiving.  Jennifer Stewart Medcalf had asked me to 
invite you to a meeting with senior Compaq executives on
December 14th.  Though the meeting will start at 1PM, Jennifer is 
specifically requesting your presence from 3-4 PM when discussions will focus 
on the Compaq/EBS relationship.  Other Compaq executives besides ""Keith"" will 
be there.


An agenda and listing of attendees will be e-mailed to you the week of 
December 11th.

Thanks for confirming back with Jennifer Medcalf your availability, from 3-4 
PM, December 14th.  She can be reached at ext.#6-8235.

John,

You might recall we spoke a few weeks ago about a system with more 
intelligence for out-of-hours trading than just leaving the products on Last 
Trade is Mid.

Attached is a suggestion for how such a system might work. It builds on 
Offset to Last Trade functionality.

The simplified description is: It tracks two variables: Intensity(Speed) and 
Bias (Buy or Sell emphasis).  As Intensity increases, the Spread increases. 
As Bias increases, the Offset increases.

I'll call later to see what you think of the idea.

Dave

 

Program Criteria

The formula which defines the trading decision-making program will need to 
work with several criteria/inputs/definitions. These might be:

Intensity (Speed) - The average time between transaction attempts, regardless 
of whether they are buys or sells. Measured as a moving average over the last 
[Intensity Factor] transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction 
Tibco messages for the Product.
Obviously, the lower the Intensity calculation, the higher the transaction 
flow. Therefore a high Intensity number indicates low transaction flow.
Intensity Factor - The number of transactions to be included in the moving 
average Intensity calculation. A possible value for this might be [4].
#Buys - The number of Buys which have occurred.
#Sells - The number of Sells which have occured.
Transaction Count - Could be either #Buys or #Sells (whichever last occured).}
Buy Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Buy occurs.
Sell Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Sell occurs.
Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR)- The amount by which the Buy Offset should be 
reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount Sell Offset should be reduced if a Buy 
occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the 
ORR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be 1.
Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR)- The amount by which #Buys should be 
reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount #Sells should be reduced if a Buy 
occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the 
TRR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be equal 
to 1.
Spread Minimum - The minimum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this 
might be [0.04]
Spread Maximum - The maximum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this 
might be [0.50]
Offset Minimum - The minimum Offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A 
possible value for this might be [0].
Offset Maximum -The maximum offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A 
possible value for this might be [0.50]
Initial Offset - The Buy and Sell Offset used when the program is started
Initial Spread - The Spread used when the program is started
Spread-Offset Minimum - The minimum amount by which Spread must exceed 
Offset. Prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer. A 
possible value for this might be [0.01]
Dead Interval - The period of time which must pass before the program will 
recalculate the above Criteria, if no transactions have taken place during 
the Dead Interval. A possible value for this might be [240] seconds.

Program Outputs

The program should output the following variables as a result of combining 
the above Criteria in a user-defined Formula:

Spread (integer) - as per current Stack Manager
Offset (integer) - as per current Stack Manager
Suspension (boolean) - Whether or not the Product should be suspended. 
Normally ""False""


Program Interface and Operation Principles

The user should be provided with a GUI which will allow them to define a 
relationship among the above Criteria, which will produce and apply the 
Outputs to a particular Product. This relationship would be defined with 
Intensity Formulas and Transaction Formulas. 

Every time a Transaction occurs, or a Dead Interval passes, the Criteria will 
be recalculated and the user-defined formulas will be reviewed by the 
program. If a Dead Interval passes without any transactions taking place, 
then Intensity = Intensity +240 and #Buys=#Buys-TRR and #Sells=#Sells-TRR and 
Buy Offset = Buy Offset- ORR and Sell Offset = Sell Offset - ORR. 

If the user-defined Formulas (see following) indicate that a change in spread 
should occur, then if the Offset is zero (in the case of a trade occurring) 
or if no trade has occured (during the passing of a Dead Interval), the 
system shall perform a Last Trade is Mid calculation around the last 
transaction, adjusting the buy and sell prices according to the new Spread 
value.

Any adjustment to the Spread shall respect the Spread-Offset Minimum. If a 
reduction in the Spread should violate the Spread-Offset Minimum, then the 
Buy Offset (or Sell Offset, or both as appropriate) shall be reduced 
accordingly. Similarly, if the Offset is increased by a Transaction Formula 
to a level greater than the Spread, the Spread shall be increased to maintain 
the Spread-Offset Minimum.

GUI/Formulas Example:

Constants
Intensity Factor: [4]
Dead Interval: [240]
Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR): [0.3]
Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR): [0.3]
Spread Minimum [0.04]
Spread Maximum [0.50]
Offset Minimum [0]
Offset Maximum [0.49]
Spread-Offset Minimum [0.01]

Intensity Formula
Formula # Intensity   Spread Offset  Suspension
S1  >220   -0.01 n/a F
S2  <30   +0.01 n/a F
S3  <10   +0.02 n/a F

Transaction Formula
Formula # # Transactions  Spread Offset  Suspension
V1  <4   n/a -0.01 F
V2  >3   n/a +0.01 F
V3  >5   +0.01 +0.02 F
V4  >10   +0.02 +0.04 F
V5  >15   +0.04 +0.15 F
V6  >20   n/a n/a T
    
Note that #Transactions would be #Buys or #Sells, as appropriate. Note also 
that #Buys and #Sells are not intended to be an absolute count, but rather 
are a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently 
occured.

In this example, all Constants and Formulae are editable by the user through 
the GUI.


Simulation

Obviously, if we want to proceed, we will want to conduct several simulations 
to prove concepts and evaluate responsiveness. However, to give some idea of 
how the above might work when a market starts to run in a particular 
direction, please see the attached:




Additional Features

System Notifications

There should be two kinds of notifications for the Robotrader, which will be 
similar to Stack Manager Garbage Checks: Warning and Failure levels for both 
Offset and Price. The warning levels will trigger a pager message. The 
Failure levels will trigger a pager message and the product will be 
automatically suspended. The Price checks will be against prices input by the 
trader (not relative price movements, but actual price). There should be both 
maximum and minimum price checks (e.g. gas is trading at $5.50. The 
notification levels could be $8 at the top end and $2 at the bottom end). 
Offset checks will only be against a maximum value.

Things I need to clarify about your ng view
1- As gas plummets are you assuming that it regains all demand (industrial 
shutdowns and fuel switchers)?
2-What is your outlook for Nov-Mar 01 and Ap-oct 02
3- How does your view change with a normal, cold or warm winter ?
4- Is your view predicated on getting to 2.6  is easy and that world did not 
end this past winter a storage level of 2.6?

1- The above spreadsheet looks at HO-NG seasonally. It gives perspective on 
'normal relationships'. 

Things I need to clarify about your ng view
1- As gas plummets are you assuming that it regains all demand (industrial 
shutdowns and fuel switchers)?
2-What is your outlook for Nov-Mar 01 and Ap-oct 02
3- How does your view change with a normal, cold or warm winter ?
4- Is your view predicated on getting to 2.6  is easy and that world did not 
end this past winter a storage level of 2.6?
5- Do you believe that we will need to price some demand out again this 
winter?

So for the period  May-Sep01 an extra 1.5Bcf/d will be put back into the

i am going to use a matt lenhart argument - alla texas lost to arkansas last 
year who lost to lsu.  . . .       texas played horribly against oregon and 
still had a great chance to win (and should have won) at the end of the 
game.  oregon beat washington who beat miami who beat fsu who should beat 
oklahoma tonite.  that means that texas should be national champions.
get real . . .  one 8-4 season after a decade of failure does not a 
championship caliber program make.  our team did the same thing right after 
mack arrived (9-3 with big win in cotton bowl) you can expect about the same 
next year.
lsu is getting some good recruits this year - you should be happy - in a 
couple of years your team will compete for sec and national championships.
but don't start talking smack after a win over a lousy ACC team.

i am going to use a matt lenhart argument - alla texas lost to arkansas last 
year who lost to lsu.  . . .       texas played horribly against oregon and 
still had a great chance to win (and should have won) at the end of the 
game.  oregon beat washington who beat miami who beat fsu who should beat 
oklahoma tonite.  that means that texas should be national champions.
get real . . .  one 8-4 season after a decade of failure does not a 
championship caliber program make.  our team did the same thing right after 
mack arrived (9-3 with big win in cotton bowl) you can expect about the same 
next year.
lsu is getting some good recruits this year - you should be happy - in a 
couple of years your team will compete for sec and national championships.
but don't start talking smack after a win over a lousy ACC team.

One of the things that Greg Piper has asked me to do is to take a look at the 
rest of the year and get each of the VP's to assess their margins and EBIT 
for the remainder of 2001.  For Energy Operations, that is usually very easy 
since there has been no revenues, and all of the costs are allocated out, so 
there should be zero EBIT if nothing changed.  Given your present direction, 
however, you may be generating some margin in 2001.  Do you have a feel for 
an amount I can put into our analysis and will 100% of your costs continue to 
be billed out or will some be applied to this new activity? I am hoping to 
put something together next week, so if you or a designate could let me know 
in a few days I would appreciate it.

Shona,
When we returned from Argentina we concluded that a proper risk management 
system needed to be implemented in order to posture the office for success. 
They have been trading there for over 2 years which is plenty of time to do 
so.  We used Enpower as a phrase meaning ""Proper Risk System"".  If there are 
real questions about the functionality of such, then that obviously begs the 
question as to why we allow someone to transact on behalf of Enron 7500 miles 
away that doesn't understand.  That being said Mike Guerrero seems perfectly 
hip to having the best platform available.  It was Enron NetWorks that said 
that they could implement a ""controlled spreadsheet environment"" that would 
have ALL the functionality of a proper risk system, including risk 
aggregation into RisktRAC, credit aggregation and tracking, option valuation, 
scalability, security and stability. I will not opine on such matters.  They 
must produce or stop transacting.

Lavarato has stopped efforts for implementing Enpower in South America until 
business activity increases enough to support it.
Based on below, we will start looking for someone with strong Access/Excel

regroup and determine next steps and look at revised timelines.

Subject: EnPower production - Argentina Power
Richard / Beth,  We have been asked by risk to get Argentina started on 
EnPower.  Are you OK with us moving on this?  A couple things to consider...
Our instance strategy for EnPower is determined by geographic location 
(bandwidth), volumes, and market similarity (functionality).  Based on this, 
I want to set South America up on their own instance.  EnPower will have the 
following instances long term:  EUR, US, CND, SA, AUS, JPN, IND.  We will 
continue to pursue a common code base and logical data model.
There is additional time and cost associated with setting up a new instance, 
however, I am concerned about continuing to pile new business units into a 
production environment that will eventually need to be split.
Glad to discuss...  Please respond quickly, as we are waiting to pull the 
trigger on this...

Lavarato has stopped efforts for implementing Enpower in South America until 
business activity increases enough to support it.
Based on below, we will start looking for someone with strong Access/Excel 
knowledge to come up with a different solution.  Everyone will have to 
regroup and determine next steps and look at revised timelines.

Subject: EnPower production - Argentina Power
Richard / Beth,  We have been asked by risk to get Argentina started on 
EnPower.  Are you OK with us moving on this?  A couple things to consider...
Our instance strategy for EnPower is determined by geographic location 
(bandwidth), volumes, and market similarity (functionality).  Based on this, 
I want to set South America up on their own instance.  EnPower will have the 
following instances long term:  EUR, US, CND, SA, AUS, JPN, IND.  We will 
continue to pursue a common code base and logical data model.
There is additional time and cost associated with setting up a new instance, 
however, I am concerned about continuing to pile new business units into a 
production environment that will eventually need to be split.
Glad to discuss...  Please respond quickly, as we are waiting to pull the 
trigger on this...

Shona,
When we returned from Argentina we concluded that a proper risk management 
system needed to be implemented in order to posture the office for success. 
They have been trading there for over 2 years which is plenty of time to do 
so.  We used Enpower as a phrase meaning ""Proper Risk System"".  If there are 
real questions about the functionality of such, then that obviously begs the 
question as to why we allow someone to transact on behalf of Enron 7500 miles 
away that doesn't understand.  That being said Mike Guerrero seems perfectly 
hip to having the best platform available.  It was Enron NetWorks that said 
that they could implement a ""controlled spreadsheet environment"" that would 
have ALL the functionality of a proper risk system, including risk 
aggregation into RisktRAC, credit aggregation and tracking, option valuation, 
scalability, security and stability. I will not opine on such matters.  They 
must produce or stop transacting.

One of the things that Greg Piper has asked me to do is to take a look at the 
rest of the year and get each of the VP's to assess their margins and EBIT 
for the remainder of 2001.  For Energy Operations, that is usually very easy 
since there has been no revenues, and all of the costs are allocated out, so 
there should be zero EBIT if nothing changed.  Given your present direction, 
however, you may be generating some margin in 2001.  Do you have a feel for 
an amount I can put into our analysis and will 100% of your costs continue to 
be billed out or will some be applied to this new activity? I am hoping to 
put something together next week, so if you or a designate could let me know 
in a few days I would appreciate it.

I just want to give you an update on the Executive Report Viewer project in 
case you are not aware of the status. The development of the ERV project has 
been completed and delivered on schedule. The feedback from the demo was very 
positive. The application has been handed over for user acceptance test.

One of the things that Greg Piper has asked me to do is to take a look at the 
rest of the year and get each of the VP's to assess their margins and EBIT 
for the remainder of 2001.  For Energy Operations, that is usually very easy 
since there has been no revenues, and all of the costs are allocated out, so 
there should be zero EBIT if nothing changed.  Given your present direction, 
however, you may be generating some margin in 2001.  Do you have a feel for 
an amount I can put into our analysis and will 100% of your costs continue to 
be billed out or will some be applied to this new activity? I am hoping to 
put something together next week, so if you or a designate could let me know 
in a few days I would appreciate it.

Please review the tax advance letter prepared for Diomedes Christodoulou.  We 
are wanting to make sure he agrees to reimburse Enron for any Brazilian tax 
credit received for the US tax payments made by Enron.  

Do you have any suggested wording in the event he is terminated either 
voluntarily or involuntarily?  The payment would still not be due to Enron 
until receipt of any Brazilian tax refund, however, we would like him to 
acknowledge that the refunds would still be due to Enron.  I'm not sure if 
the sentence I have included in the second paragraph is sufficient.

-14520.0,"Generally speaking, nothing has changed since we last spoke.  One small 
change is currently contemplated however.   Seller has insisted that we give 
them a maximum number of non-union employees that we will want them to 
terminate.  We have suggested that the maximum number be 30.  This seems good 
at least for WARN Act purposes.  As it is currently contemplated (not in the 
documents but rather in the most recent negotiations), we would provide the 
Seller with written notice (no later than 3 or 4 business days before closing 
but after our financing contingency has expired) as to which employees would 
need to be terminated.  One other thing that I have heard is that we want the 
Seller to be the terminating party because the commercial folks would prefer 
not to have to tell our analysts that we did the firing.  If you and the 
other labor folks feel strongly about making the Buyer the terminating party, 
please call me ASAP and I can hook you in with Rodney Malcolm et al to 
discuss.  The deal is set to be finalized tomorrow.

This will confirm my telephone conferences with Dorie this morning.  Again, I 
was able to contact Rodney Tow, and Tow reported to me that he spoke with Joe 
Walker of TMAC this morning and told him that Enron did not want him at the 
party.  Tow will follow that up with a note to Walker.

I believe Walker's confusion was created by Diane Neilsen.  Before he called 
Walker, Tow read to me a telefax that Neilsen had sent to Walker after 
hearing from Tow that we did not want Walker at the party.  The fax simply 
said that Enron did not want any type of religious orientation in the show, 
but never said that Enron didn't want him at the party.

I also asked Walker how he was doing on getting our security in place.  Tow, 
who had just walked into the office when I called, said that he was working 
on it, that he had just received a letter from Neilsen regarding it (which he 
apparently had not read), and that he had to let me go because he had clients 
on the line.

On another note:  I received a copy of a transmittal memorandum from Kriste 
Sullivan to Mike Rosen, which attaches an unexecuted copy of a confidential 
draft of the Master Consulting Services Agreement between Enron Corp. and 
Event Resources Inc. in this matter.  Kriste says in the memo that her 
records do not indicate that execution copies were prepared.

The signature blanks are for Mark Palmer of Corp. and Ken Price of ERI (who 
has left).  I was going to try to interview Price anyway regarding such 
things as where ERI kept its money, whether he believed that when he signed 
the Hilton agreement he was signing as an agent, and other matters.  I can 
also ask him if he ever signed any master agreement with Enron.  What do you 
think?

I notice my calender doesn't yet seem to have this meeting scheduled. I will 
ask Kay Chapman (since Rhonna has now deserted me!) to help put a time 
together. Drew/Mary, FYI sorry I didn't get a chance to send you this before. 
Let me know if you want to attend, happy to have you there.

Gerry, can you help me put an agenda together so that everyone knows what we 
are looking to achieve here. In broad terms I am looking to do the following:

Update all on project we set HR Associate group and their recommendations
Discuss their recommendations and look at any refinements or ideas we think 
we should also incorporate (see my thumb nail sketch notes inspired by 
Associate group below).
Reaffirm commitment to take this project forward and agree:
Team for doing so
Resources and timimg
Methodology for agreeing final version.
My ambition is that we (but in particular Andrea, Bob, Gerry, Tim, Tana, Dan, 
Neil, myself and possibly Suzanne if she can given the work she had already 
done in this area) all agree to contribute to this and get it done without 
the need for a formation of a new team or group. Obviously everyone welcome 
to participate.

Tana/Dan,

Can you cicruclate a summary of your teams proposals to this group so we they 
can review before meeting. Could you also agree within your team who you 
would like to attend this meeting (I would suggest 2 or 3 of you attend 
rather than all).

Thanks




David

Rhonna,

Please arrange a meeting later this week for all of those addressed by this 
message (Vince, it would great if one of your team could attend since we will 
need some heavy statistical and analytical help to complete this project).

The prupose of the meeting will be to discuss and delegate next steps 
required to implement the HR Associate groups recommendations for the 
development of an HR ""value index"" at Enron.

I would anticipate we will need approx 45minutes.

David

Please review the tax advance letter prepared for Diomedes Christodoulou.  We 
are wanting to make sure he agrees to reimburse Enron for any Brazilian tax 
credit received for the US tax payments made by Enron.  

Do you have any suggested wording in the event he is terminated either 
voluntarily or involuntarily?  The payment would still not be due to Enron 
until receipt of any Brazilian tax refund, however, we would like him to 
acknowledge that the refunds would still be due to Enron.  I'm not sure if 
the sentence I have included in the second paragraph is sufficient.

",False
-14520.0,"Generally speaking, nothing has changed since we last spoke.  One small 
change is currently contemplated however.   Seller has insisted that we give 
them a maximum number of non-union employees that we will want them to 
terminate.  We have suggested that the maximum number be 30.  This seems good 
at least for WARN Act purposes.  As it is currently contemplated (not in the 
documents but rather in the most recent negotiations), we would provide the 
Seller with written notice (no later than 3 or 4 business days before closing 
but after our financing contingency has expired) as to which employees would 
need to be terminated.  One other thing that I have heard is that we want the 
Seller to be the terminating party because the commercial folks would prefer 
not to have to tell our analysts that we did the firing.  If you and the 
other labor folks feel strongly about making the Buyer the terminating party, 
please call me ASAP and I can hook you in with Rodney Malcolm et al to 
discuss.  The deal is set to be finalized tomorrow.

This will confirm my telephone conferences with Dorie this morning.  Again, I 
was able to contact Rodney Tow, and Tow reported to me that he spoke with Joe 
Walker of TMAC this morning and told him that Enron did not want him at the 
party.  Tow will follow that up with a note to Walker.

I believe Walker's confusion was created by Diane Neilsen.  Before he called 
Walker, Tow read to me a telefax that Neilsen had sent to Walker after 
hearing from Tow that we did not want Walker at the party.  The fax simply 
said that Enron did not want any type of religious orientation in the show, 
but never said that Enron didn't want him at the party.

I also asked Walker how he was doing on getting our security in place.  Tow, 
who had just walked into the office when I called, said that he was working 
on it, that he had just received a letter from Neilsen regarding it (which he 
apparently had not read), and that he had to let me go because he had clients 
on the line.

On another note:  I received a copy of a transmittal memorandum from Kriste 
Sullivan to Mike Rosen, which attaches an unexecuted copy of a confidential 
draft of the Master Consulting Services Agreement between Enron Corp. and 
Event Resources Inc. in this matter.  Kriste says in the memo that her 
records do not indicate that execution copies were prepared.

The signature blanks are for Mark Palmer of Corp. and Ken Price of ERI (who 
has left).  I was going to try to interview Price anyway regarding such 
things as where ERI kept its money, whether he believed that when he signed 
the Hilton agreement he was signing as an agent, and other matters.  I can 
also ask him if he ever signed any master agreement with Enron.  What do you 
think?

Subject: Summary of Weekend events:
Governor, Utility In War Of Words--Davis furious as PG&E defends bankruptcy 
filing 

This pretty much summarizes the events over the weekend resulting from PG&E's 
filing on Monday--more stellar leadership from the administration.
Biggest news is that the Governor is now frantically trying to cobble 
together a Tx buy-out deal with Edison & Sempra; but note that Burton in this 
story questions whether it makes sense to buy Tx if PG&E isn't part of the 
deal.
The first hearing on the bankruptcy is today.

Governor, Utility In War Of Words 
Davis furious as PG&E defends bankruptcy filing

N223519.DTL 
California's energy mess took an ugly turn yesterday as Gov. Gray Davis and 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. traded barbs over who is to blame for the 
bankruptcy of the state's largest utility. 
In a series of tit-for-tat statements, each side laid claim to the moral high 
ground while insisting that the other had been dealing in bad faith. 
The governor spent part of his time yesterday giving television interviews in 
response to The Chronicle's report Saturday that PG&E awarded $50 million in 
bonuses and raises to 6,000 employees just hours before Friday's bankruptcy 
filing. 
""PG&E's management is suffering from two afflictions: denial and greed,"" 
Davis said in a brief statement Saturday night. 
In a testy reply, PG&E countered that ""instead of focusing all his attention 
on solving the state's yearlong and ever-worsening energy crisis, the 
governor has launched a campaign-style attack on our company."" 
PG&E said Davis was criticizing ""thousands of men and women who have worked 
tirelessly and professionally through this crisis"" and concluded that 
""California would be far better served if the governor turned his attention 
to the crisis at hand."" 
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, fired back yesterday: ""PG&E 
waged a public relations war on Friday. If they're looking for somebody to 
blame, they should look in the mirror."" 
Maviglio also said the governor was concentrating on reaching a final accord 
with Southern California Edison Co. for the state to purchase the cash- 
strapped company's power lines for nearly $2.8 billion. 
A last round of talks was scheduled to be held last night. 
""There are a few remaining details to be worked out, but it seems pretty 
close,"" Maviglio said, adding that an announcement of the deal could come as 
early as today. 
""The governor is spending his time negotiating with a responsible utility,"" 
he said. 
Along with the Edison deal, Davis spent the weekend huddling with energy 
advisers and lawyers trying to come up with an appropriate response to PG&E's 
bankruptcy bombshell. 
Efforts to stabilize California's dysfunctional electricity market suddenly 
have become much more complex. 
NOT MUCH CHANGED
Nevertheless, while PG&E's bankruptcy is by far the most sensational aspect 
of California's long-drawn-out energy mess, at the end of the day, it doesn't 
really change a thing. 
Consider: 
-- PG&E's financial woes stem from a rate freeze that prevented the utility 
from passing along to customers runaway wholesale power costs. That rate 
freeze and sky-high electricity prices remain in place. 
-- California's energy shortage is primarily the result of the state not 
having built any major power plants for the past 12 years. PG&E's bankruptcy 
does nothing to affect that precarious situation. 
-- PG&E's foray into bankruptcy court does not alter the fact that 
electricity demand is outpacing available supply. California consumers still 
face a threat of daily blackouts when power usage spikes this summer. 
""The crux of the problem is still the same,"" said Loretta Lynch, president of 
the state Public Utilities Commission. ""We face the same challenges we did 
before PG&E filed for bankruptcy."" 
She added, however, that PG&E's bankruptcy ""increases the uncertainty."" 
The utility doesn't see it that way. 
PG&E spokesman Ron Low said California's energy woes are no more uncertain 
now than they were when the company ostensibly was negotiating with Davis to 
find an equitable solution to the state's troubles. 
""California remains in an energy crisis,"" he said. ""As we head toward summer, 
resources are going to be very tight."" 
WHAT COULD HAPPEN
In the short run, consumers will notice no change whatsoever. Bankruptcy 
protection will allow PG&E to continue operating as usual while the company's 
creditors line up to receive at least partial payment of outstanding bills. 
Longer term, there is a very real possibility that electricity rates will 
soar if the bankruptcy judge agrees with PG&E that conditions for lifting the 
rate freeze were met a year ago and that $9 billion in subsequent expenses 
must be borne by consumers. 
How much people's bills would rise depends on how the rate increase is 
structured. It would probably come in the form of a surcharge on existing 
fees, 
but the monthly hit to consumers could be limited by spreading the total cost 
over a number of years. 
The big question mark now is how PG&E's bankruptcy will affect various 
political and legislative measures intended to keep California's lights on. 
The state's attempt to purchase PG&E's power lines is obviously finished, 
although a new deal could be negotiated in bankruptcy court. 
Meanwhile, the governor is pressing ahead with plans to purchase the 
transmission systems of Edison and Sempra Energy's San Diego utility -- 
although what the state would do with only a partial power grid has yet to be 
determined. 
""Does it make any sense to have the transmission lines of Edison and Sempra 
and not PG&E?"" asked state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San 
Francisco. ""I don't know the answer to that."" 
A final accord with Edison this week would validate PG&E's apparent concerns 
that it would have had a harder time limiting backlash to its bankruptcy 
filing if the utility had acted after a breakthrough with Edison was 
unveiled. 
The Chronicle quoted PG&E insiders yesterday as saying that the decision to 
file for bankruptcy had been made early last week, even though senior company 
officials said the move followed the governor's Thursday night speech on 
solving California's energy issues. 
One reason PG&E opted to file on Friday morning was because a final deal with 
Edison was expected at any time, observers said. 
Paul Patterson, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, noted that if PG&E 
had filed for bankruptcy after Edison came to terms with the state, ""they 
would be seen as a spoiler."" 
ENSUING CONFUSION
In any case, PG&E's surprise filing has left all concerned scrambling for 
footing in the changed political landscape. 
Consumer advocates watched with dismay yesterday as the state's political and 
corporate powers slugged it out for supremacy. 
Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San 
Francisco, said all this finger-pointing will do nothing to ensure that 
Californians have ample supplies of electricity this summer. 
""These guys should grow up and come up with a situation that works for the 
public,"" she said.

Subject: More Info: PG&E to Announce Open Season on Redwood and Baja Early 
Next Week

PG&E will announce via press release very early next week an open season on 
Redwood, Baja and Silverado.
It comes in direct response to recent announcements of expansions into 
California by pipelines.
The bid protocols will be structured similar to original open season from the 
original Gas Accord.
The open season will start on June 1 and end on July 31.
Capacity will be available starting 1.1.03.
Bidders will be able to bid up to 30 years (PG&E states that that's what 
generators want).
Accompanying the announcement will be another announcement that PG&E will 
expand Redwood by 200mmcf/day, which they hope to have available by 1.1.03, 
or some time during Q103.
About 2-4 weeks after the open season begins, PG&E will file its proposed 
""Gas Accord II,""  (the first one expires end of 02).
As part of that filing, PG&E will offer its proposed ratemaking treatment for 
the next five years (beginning 1.1.03).
PG&E will not include in the open season 1) core capacity and 2) certain EAD 
contracts that extend beyond the Gas Accord 1 end date.
In addition, PG&E will hold back an additional 20% (after excluding core and 
EAD), to be ""open-seasoned"" at some ""future"" date.
The capacity to be auctioned is: 1) 900 mmcf/day on Redwood, 2) 245 (annual) 
on Baja, plus an additional 200/day in summer on Baja, 3) 155 on Silverado.
How PG&E will market the 20% they intend to hold back, and when they might 
auction it off in the future will be discussed in PG&E's Gas Accord II filing.
No single company will be awarded more than 30% of the capacity on any 
specific path in the primary open season (though firms can bid whatever level 
of capacity they choose).

Please forwad along to anyone else who might be interested.  If you have any 
questions, just holler.

Best,
Jeff

contracts that extend beyond the Gas Accord 1 end date.
In addition, PG&E will hold back an additional 20% (after excluding core and 
EAD), to be ""open-seasoned"" at some ""future"" date.
The capacity to be auctioned is: 1) 900 mmcf/day on Redwood, 2) 245 (annual) 
on Baja, plus an additional 200/day in summer on Baja, 3) 155 on Silverado.
How PG&E will market the 20% they intend to hold back, and when they might 
auction it off in the future will be discussed in PG&E's Gas Accord II filing.
No single company will be awarded more than 30% of the capacity on any 
specific path in the primary open season (though firms can bid whatever level 
of capacity they choose).

Please forwad along to anyone else who might be interested.  If you have any 
questions, just holler.

Subject: More Info: PG&E to Announce Open Season on Redwood and Baja Early 
Next Week

PG&E will announce via press release very early next week an open season on 
Redwood, Baja and Silverado.
It comes in direct response to recent announcements of expansions into 
California by pipelines.
The bid protocols will be structured similar to original open season from the 
original Gas Accord.
The open season will start on June 1 and end on July 31.
Capacity will be available starting 1.1.03.
Bidders will be able to bid up to 30 years (PG&E states that that's what 
generators want).
Accompanying the announcement will be another announcement that PG&E will 
expand Redwood by 200mmcf/day, which they hope to have available by 1.1.03, 
or some time during Q103.
About 2-4 weeks after the open season begins, PG&E will file its proposed 
""Gas Accord II,""  (the first one expires end of 02).
As part of that filing, PG&E will offer its proposed ratemaking treatment for 
the next five years (beginning 1.1.03).
PG&E will not include in the open season 1) core capacity and 2) certain EAD 
contracts that extend beyond the Gas Accord 1 end date.
In addition, PG&E will hold back an additional 20% (after excluding core and 
EAD), to be ""open-seasoned"" at some ""future"" date.
The capacity to be auctioned is: 1) 900 mmcf/day on Redwood, 2) 245 (annual) 
on Baja, plus an additional 200/day in summer on Baja, 3) 155 on Silverado.
How PG&E will market the 20% they intend to hold back, and when they might 
auction it off in the future will be discussed in PG&E's Gas Accord II filing.
No single company will be awarded more than 30% of the capacity on any 
specific path in the primary open season (though firms can bid whatever level 
of capacity they choose).

Please forwad along to anyone else who might be interested.  If you have any 
questions, just holler.

CALL FOR AGENDA ITEMS INPUT

I have worked closely with Anthony Mazy (Calif Public Utility Comm - Office 
of Ratepayer Advocates) in the past, and he asked me to provide input from 
Enron with our perspective on the energy mess in California for a conference 
they are putting together in October.  (Prior to joining EES I trained the 
CPUC ORA staff on a variety of issues and have earned their trust.)  However, 
I feel that the Enron input into this CPUC conference would be more 
appropriately provided by other members of the EES & ENA team, so I wanted to 
pass this email along to you for your review and action as needed.  

Let me know if my relationship with Anthony and other members of the CPUC 
staff could be useful in advancing Enron's positions at this conference.

CONFERENCE:? "" THE CALIFORNIA DISASTER: LESSONS LEARNED "" 
??????????????????????????????????????????????????? (Working Title) 

DATE:????????????????????????????????? Saturday,? October 21, 2000 

LOCATION:?????????????????????? University of California, Berkeley 

The CPUC Office of Ratepayer Advocates (ORA) together with the University of 
California is organizing a special conference, Saturday October 21, 2000, to 
address the current wholesale electricity market situation, as manifest in 
San Diego, and in light of both the economic framework and industrial 
realities in which utility restructuring is taking place.

We wish to emphasize the importance of maintaining consistent and predictable 
forward progress with the restructuring of the electric services industry, 
while remediating structural shortcomings as they appear.? The need for a 
quick and effective response to the cost escalation in California is urgent.? 
Meanwhile, we do not want to overlook emerging generation and information 
technologies and their appropriate role in an increasingly competitive energy 
and utility sector.

Your input is urgently requested to develop the detailed agenda for this 
workshop/conference.? We have had the opportunity to speak with some of you 
directly, and we appreciate your comments.? We are presently concluding 
negotiations with key national observers to be participants, and must 
complete the detailed agenda this week.? If you have any further topical 
insights to share with us, I must have your input no later than 4:00 p.m. 
Pacific time, Thursday, September 14.? (By 4:00 p.m., Wednesday, if at all 
possible.)

Let me emphasize that today we are only concerned with conceptual, topical 
content, so please do not trouble yourselves with highly ""stylized"" 
presentations.?? Our immediate objective is to release a preliminary program, 
with a partial list of key participants, by Monday, September 18th, that we 
believe is likely to secure the active support of a wide range of industry 
stakeholders.? We plan to distribute a final program by Monday, September 
25th.

Please suggest topical areas that you can help develop, or believe are 
essential to the success of this program.? We will be particularly interested 
in your informed, practical insights into:

the daily operations of the electric services industry, from various 
perspectives, that help clarify problems and distinguish truly problematic 
issues from those misunderstood,

the political and legislative processes in California, as they may tend to 
suggest effective courses of action to promote short-term market 
accommodations that are consistent with, and constructive toward, long-term 
goals for industry restructuring,

case studies from other jurisdictions that shed light on the probable 
response of California's institutions to any of the various proposed 
solutions currently circulating,

case studies of anachronistic or otherwise inefficient industry practices 
impeding development, interconnection, or operation of distributed 
generation, or the sale or other transfer of the energy produced,

case studies of market power abuse, or gaming, in both transmission and 
generation, 

proposals for innovative treatment of cost-effective emerging generation 
and/or information technologies, 

proposals for developing greater diversity of generation technologies and/or 
energy providers within the state, 

otherwise appropriate technical, economic, or regulatory principles and 
practices that are being misrepresented in the academic, trade, or popular 
press or other media, 

distinguishing informational difficulties or factual disagreements from 
policy conflicts or conflicts of interest, and 

specific suggestions for speakers who are particularly effective in 
addressing specific key issues or establishing confidence with the target 
audiences.

Attendance at this conference/workshop will be limited, with approximately 
one-half of the seats reserved for key policymakers and/or their aides, key 
agency staff, and the speakers.? The remaining seats will be allocated among 
interested consumer representatives, manufacturers, vendors, developers, and 
other end-users, and local government and community and business 
representatives.? We presently envision the conference to include one or two 
key speakers, with four panels of three to seven persons each addressing 
specific topics.? We are also reserving facilities for Friday evening to 
address topical seminars requested by decisionmakers and/or their key staff 
and additional facilities for Sunday morning when the information technology 
and distributed generation communities will be invited to provide additional 
follow-on to questions and comments offered by key policymakers on Saturday.

Some have commented that we should have started this as much as a year ago.? 
Unfortunately, a year ago we did not know that today we would have doubled 
and tripled consumer energy bills or a $250/MWH wholesale price cap, much 
less an intense, across-the-board attack on electric restructuring by some 
parties.? We are especially concerned about the efforts of some distribution 
utilities to establish a foothold in DG, the efforts of some utilities and 
the independent system operator to restrict distribution-level wheeling and 
the aggregation it would facilitate, and the latest proposal to reintegrate 
metering into the distribution utility after it was successfully unbundled 
for the benefit of competitive Energy Service Providers.? Likewise, language 
in recent legislation echoing regulatory arguments for retrenchment cannot be 
brushed aside.? 

We understand the difficulty of organizing such an event on less than two 
months notice, but we also appreciate the importance of the subject, as we 
are sure you do as well.? We are committed to preparing an event worthy of 
the time and attention of both key national observers and top-ranked 
California policymakers in the executive, legislative, and regulatory arenas, 
and we would welcome your active assistance.? 

If you have any questions, you are welcomed to call me, at 415-703-3036 from 
9:30 AM to 5:30 PM Pacific time.? For those with particularly busy schedules 
or time zone considerations, you are welcomed to call me at my personal 
telephone 925-855-0554 from 5:30 to 7:30 AM Pacific time.

Jeff and I have spent some time discussing Sempra issues and decided to use 
the meeting delay as an opportunity to develop some power price structures 
that may be interesting to them. This is all driven by PG&E's recent move to 
fix prices for upwards of 1,000 MW's.  The pressure will be on SDG&E and SCE 
to do likewise.

 I will be in Portland on Monday and hope to get some time with you to 
discuss this but wanted to provide you with a preview.

Jeff and I discussed some structures that might be attractive to Sempra given 
the regulatory and shareholder risk they face should they (1) continue to buy 
power at market prices and/or (2) lock in a fixed price: 
(a) costless collar,
(b) fixed price coupled with writing long-dated puts, and 
(c) price cap.

These structures are intended to address Sempra's risk exposure.  Our 
underlying understanding is:
1)  Continued purchases @ market exposes Sempra to substantial regulatory and 
shareholder risk,
2)  Fixing the price mitigates both of these risks,
3)  A costless collar arguably keeps Sempra in the market limiting their 
exposure to higher prices but allowing them to benefit from lower prices,
4)  Writing the put generates a premium which can be applied to lower a fixed 
price, and
5)  Holding a call eliminates their exposure to high prices and allows them 
to benefit from lower prices.

With that said, I expect the cost of the call to be huge.  However, the 
costless collar and fixed price with a put could be attractive.  The only 
problem with collars is that our bid-offer spread typically skews the band 
such that if the underlying price were $50, a cap with a $70 strike would be 
associated with a $40 strike on the put.

Our thought was to get some notional prices and but together a few plots to 
illustrate how these products work.
 
What do you think?

Subject:  JDS Uniphase Corporation Strongly Supports
      Retention of Direct Access and asks for CPUC Support

Dear Commissioner Geoffrey F. Brown:

My name is Kenneth D. Pietrelli, Vice President of Corporate Services for the
Thin Film Products Group(formerly OCLI and Flex Products) of JDS Uniphase in
Santa Rosa, California.  I am asking for your support to retain Direct Access 
as
an option for industrial energy customers such as JDS Uniphase.  Electricity 
and
natural gas are critical infrastructural requirements for our manufacturing
processes.  Without access to reliable sources, at high quality and 
competitive
prices we cannot satisfy our customers needs and be a viable business in
California.  We fear loss of direct access will have a material, adverse 
effect
on our business in California where we currently employ approximately 5,000
employees. JDS Uniphase is made up of such diverse groups as the original
Uniphase Commercial Lasers Group in San Jose and Manteca, the E-Tek Dynamics
Company in San Jose, SDLI in San Jose and Santa Clara and OCLI and Flex 
Products
in Santa Rosa.  The corporation has over 20,000 employees in over 20 
countries.
Of all the sites in California only the Santa Rosa site has direct access, 
which
is due to various historical and operational reasons.  We own a 22Mw 
substation
located on our 75 acre plant site and are considered a grid level customer.  
Up
to now we have enjoyed high quality, reliable electrical energy.  In the mid
1990's we began contracting directly for natural gas from other than PG& E and
are currently sourcing gas from Pan Canadian Energy via a single point gas 
meter
for the site.  In 1998 we entered into a 5 year direct access electricity
contract with PG& E Energy Services.  In 2000 this contract was assigned by 
PG&E
Energy Services to Enron and is valid through June 30, 2003.   Because of the
importance of energy availability, quality and price to our manufacturing
operations we have made business decisions on where capital investments have
been made and where redundant operations would be consolidated.  We are in the
process of a global re-alignment program that is consolidating numerous
activities to Santa Rosa, CA for a variety of reasons, to include our direct
access to energy.

 If direct access is eliminated in California, JDS Uniphase management will 
have
to re-assess and re-consider actions currently underway to consolidate
manufacturing from Rochester, NY; Ottawa, Canada; Dunfermline Fife, Scotland;
and San Jose, Ca to the Santa Rosa, CA site. Other locations on the East Coast
of the U.S., China, UK, etc. would have to be re-considered for these
consolidation activities.  Selfishly, we are asking you to retain direct 
access
to keep jobs in California.  Philosophically, we believe the ""right to choose""
is an American tradition and anyone concerned with the long-term health and
viability of the California economy would want to retain the direct access
option for California customers.   Thanks for your time and support.

Subject: Brief Summary of Today's Activities in California (at Least Thus 
Far)  

The Commission voted out the order 5-0, essentially as it appeared 
yesterday.  Three key changes:
They clarified that the surcharge applies to Direct Access customers (but the 
entire ""rate freeze"" structure remains intact for now).
The Commission reversed itself and chose not to adopt TURN's ""netting out"" of 
gen revenues and CTC collections, and said instead that the Commission will 
consider it as an option in the next phase (a move likely made in order to 
lower chances of a successful utility appeal).
The Commission added to the decision language saying that it will study the 
pros/cons of securitizating the utilities' power purchase costs.  They will 
submit a report on the issue to the Governor and Legislature.
On this last point, wire reports are rampant about the possibility that 
legislation will be introduced as early as today proposing to securitize the 
utilties' power purchase costs.  This action has reportedly been the result 
of discussions that occured through the night between the governor's office, 
the utilities and the ratings agencies in reponse to the fact that the 
decision issued by the PUC falls well short of what's needed to keep the IOUs 
credit worthy and solvent.  As a result of those wires stories, the 
utilities' stock has come back (Edison was down as low as 6.25 and is 
currently at 10 7/8; PG&E was at 8 7/8 and is currently at 11 7/8).  We're 
working with Sandi McCubbin, who heads-up our legislative activities in 
California, to get more info and will report back.
The hearing was dominated by highly charged anti-generator, anti-marketer 
rhetoric, which is likely to play a prominent role in the press accounts.  
Only FERC was demonized more.
Each of the Commissioners, including the most recent ""interim"" appointee,  
made strong statements regarding the undesirability of utility bankruptcy.
The Commission left open the possibility of ""doing more"" at their next 
meeting (two weeks from today), which means the negotiations with the

Subject: Brief Summary of Today's Activities in California (at Least Thus 
Far)  

The Commission voted out the order 5-0, essentially as it appeared 
yesterday.  Three key changes:
They clarified that the surcharge applies to Direct Access customers (but the 
entire ""rate freeze"" structure remains intact for now).
The Commission reversed itself and chose not to adopt TURN's ""netting out"" of 
gen revenues and CTC collections, and said instead that the Commission will 
consider it as an option in the next phase (a move likely made in order to 
lower chances of a successful utility appeal).
The Commission added to the decision language saying that it will study the 
pros/cons of securitizating the utilities' power purchase costs.  They will 
submit a report on the issue to the Governor and Legislature.
On this last point, wire reports are rampant about the possibility that 
legislation will be introduced as early as today proposing to securitize the 
utilties' power purchase costs.  This action has reportedly been the result 
of discussions that occured through the night between the governor's office, 
the utilities and the ratings agencies in reponse to the fact that the 
decision issued by the PUC falls well short of what's needed to keep the IOUs 
credit worthy and solvent.  As a result of those wires stories, the 
utilities' stock has come back (Edison was down as low as 6.25 and is 
currently at 10 7/8; PG&E was at 8 7/8 and is currently at 11 7/8).  We're 
working with Sandi McCubbin, who heads-up our legislative activities in 
California, to get more info and will report back.
The hearing was dominated by highly charged anti-generator, anti-marketer 
rhetoric, which is likely to play a prominent role in the press accounts.  
Only FERC was demonized more.
Each of the Commissioners, including the most recent ""interim"" appointee,  
made strong statements regarding the undesirability of utility bankruptcy.
The Commission left open the possibility of ""doing more"" at their next 
meeting (two weeks from today), which means the negotiations with the 
utilities and ratings agencies are likely to continue. And if an agreement is 
reached, it could end up on the next agenda.

Quick Update

On the various matters currently before the California PUC:
The Commission order stating that the utilities should absorb any difference 
between DWR's cost of power and the retail rate freeze is still technically 
in effect.  (The order only applies, however, to the power purchased under 
the Governor's emergency order giving the State the authority to buy power.)
The utilities have petitioned to modify the decision telling the Commission 
that the easiest way to remedy the problem would be to vacate the order 
altogether, but if the Commission didn't want to vacate the order, it would 
need to change the decision so that the IOUs don't eat any shortfalls.
The Commission can act on the petition to modify whenever it chooses.  In 
addition, it has a continuation meeting scheduled for this Thursday and a 
regularly scheduled business meeting next week.  So the opportunity to act 
and fix the Order is there if the Commission wants to take it.
With respect to the cost of utility generation (i.e., retained generating 
assets and QF contracts), the Commission has a set up a schedule that 
foresses a Commission decision adopting an ""interim"" procurement charge on 
March 27th.  There is another ""workshop"" scheduled for tomorrow to discuss 
the utilities' proposals, after which the utilities will be required to file 
formal ""advice  letters"" with the Commission.  Those advice letters will form 
the basis of the process that the Commission will use to ultimately arrive at 
a decision on the 27th.
Everyone participating in the workshops takes the view that  customers will 
see a separate line item on their bills to cover the going forward costs that 
DWR incurs to buy power.  Everyone participating in the workshops also takes 
the view that customers will be on the hook for DWR's costs and the 
Commission will, if necessary, raise rates to ensure that DWR is made whole.  
(Unfortunately, the Commission is not currently sending signals to show that 
it concurs with the folks participating in the workshops.  And until there is 
clarity on whether the Commission will agree to ""pass through"" those costs, 
Enron and others will continue to have problems with DWR's credit as it 
applies to the RFP that we and others responded to last week.)
Next week begins the hearings to address the issues that Commission started 
to examine began in the emergency hearings held over the holidays, i.e., the 
utilities financial position, TURN's proposal to ""net out"" the utilitities' 
generation-related revenues with the undercollection caused by the rate cap, 
the date on which the rate has (or will) end, etc.    Recently, TURN modified 
its testimony in response to the passage of AB1X.  TURN's new position is 
that the Commission should find that the rate freeze ended on February 1st, 
the effective date of AB1X.   EES will need to quickly determine how and if 
it wants to respond to TURN's latest stance on the end of the rate freeze.
We continue to try to persuade stakeholders and the Commission that DA 
customers must be compensated for the fact that they paid for the utilities' 
stranded generating assets.  That compensation could come in one of two 
forms:  1) access to a proportionate share of the utilities' retained, 
cost-based generating assets, or 2) a credit representing the difference 
between the ""market"" value of the retained generating assets and the book 
value of those assets.  We are not getting much traction thus far.
The Commission is scheduled to issue a separate decision addressing the rate 
freeze issue, the issue of whether to net out generating-related revenues 
against the undercollection, etc. on March 27.  So both sets of issues (the 
procurement charges and the ""end of the rate freeze) are scheduled to be 
""finalized"" on March 27, albeit in separate orders.
With respect to the Block Foward issue, our lawyers had a pretty good meeting 
on Friday with the DWR general counsel and other DWR lawyers.  However, it 
has become clear that despite those efforts, FERC's decision on ""charge 
backs"" will have a significant effect on the resolution of the Block Forward 
issue.

Best,
Jeff

Subject: PUC Approves DWR Language in Decision; Removes Language Staying 
Commission Action on Direct Access

The Commission just voted out one half of the ""Bilas Alternate.""

The decision that got voted out included Bilas' DWR-based language stating 
that the PUC 1) would not second-guess DWR purchases and 2) would pass 
through DWR costs to customers.
However, in a move led by Commissioner Carl Wood, the decision removed the 
Bilas language on Direct Access.  The decision therefore did NOT include the 
Bilas language staying any Commission action on implementing the Direct 
Access prohibition.  Carl Wood called including Direct Access ""the height of 
arrogance.""  
The decision was voted out 3-2, with the 2 remaining Republicans dissenting.
That said, the Commission has no proposal before it implementing the 
prohibition, and there was no talk at the meeting of implementing the 
prohibition any time soon.

Best,
Jeff

 I hope you are both doing well.  I have some questions for you about this 
matter that will help me on a jurisdictional legal issue:  

 1.  Can we say that for each of the spot gas sales that you made to Triad, 
Triad would have called you (or someone else with ENA) first, and that you 
would have taken the call in Houston?  I am assuming that this is probably 
the case, but I would like to get confirmation from each of you. 

 2.  Did Sherwood Purnell or anyone else from Triad ever come to Houston to 
meet with either of you (or anyone else with ENA of whom you are aware)?

 3.  Are there any other contacts between Triad and Texas that either of you 
are aware of?

 Many thanks for your usual quick response.

How's your summer?  Are you in Delaware now?  I am going to set up a
weekend in DC in the Fall and I will probably do it around homecoming
weekend.  I want to try and set it up for most of the people will huge out
with, but will take other suggestions.  I will be sending out e-mails to
everyone informing them of the weekend.  Choby is going to set up a bar to
rent out for Saturday night.  In the past, you have sent me e-mails with a
bunch of different e-mail addresses attached to it.  If you could send me a

My Dad has the tickets and is going to keep them with him.  He doesn't want
them to get lost in the mail.  We are staying in Cincinatti and are driving
over Sat and Monday for the games.  The best thing to do is meet at a
certain gate # or the ""will call window"".  I will call your Dad next week
and set things up on a meeting place before the game.  Leave me your Dad's

Hey Mike,
Thanks for the pics.  Where were the ones from which  looks to be a wedding?
Hey, how many tickets were you thinking about? Were you thinking two for you
and
your Dad?  That weekend is April 1 & 3, 2000.  I'm not sure whether that is
Easter weekend or not.  One other way to get tics is to go to

the
New Year?  Talk to you later.

		 Subject: Re: Intellectual Property Rights Protection in Confidentiality 
Agreements

Not quite sure what you mean by ""information developed"" from a value or 
exploitation perspective, or understand the exposure you believe we have 
under our existing, well drafted confidentiality agreements, to which I take 
no credit whatsoever, unfortunately. 

We should not be using the information disclosed by a counterparty for any  
purpose other than to evaluate and negotiate any possible transaction with 
that counterparty. To use it for any other purpose would be in breach of the 
confidentiality agreement. Since we are discussing the information and 
disclosing it to each other it is caught by the confidentiality undertakings. 
 
If we develop any  information independently without the benefit of any 
confidential information received from the disclosing counterparty, then of 
course we can claim it as ours, before expiry of the term of the 
confidentiality agreement, and protect it accordingly and the counterparty 
would have to establish that we did not develop it independently without the 
benefit of their confidential information.
 
During the period of the confidentiality agreement, ownership of information 
that we developed using a counterparty's confidential information is not an 
issue, since we can only use it for the purposes set out in the relevant 
confidentiality agreement. If we want to use it for any other purpose, during 
the term of the confidentiality agreement, we will need to reach agreement 
with the counterparty as to any rights for exploitation in a substantive 
agreement, recognising that we may will be mixing intellectual property 
rights.

Marcus

Alan -

I agree that we need to make some revisions and, having read Marcus' 
comments, I agree also that broad language covers the general concepts.  I 
believe ownership of information developed during discussions will be the hot 
area, especially where we are discussing projects with companies while we 
developed parallel projects.  These situations make Enron an easy target.  

Though the general language of the agreement covers this generally, enhanced 
language should be considered.

Please let me know if you want to pursue this further.

I have been thinking that we should enhance our Confidentiality Agreement

we should do something? If so what modifications should be made? Peter Mims, 
the VE lawyer at the offsite last Octobe, might be a good person to work with

Subject: NYPSC approves market-based backout credit for RG&E; Adopts Enron 
Online as Index

Another big victory for Enron in New York! In an Order issued by the NYPSC on 
March 29, the NYPSC has approved a proposal to modify the existing fixed 
backout credit of 2.8 cents per kwh for energy and capacity and replace it 
with a market-based backout credit. The additional retail adder of 0.4 cents 
per kwh would remain.  Load-serving entities (LSEs) will have the option of 
continuing to buy their energy and capacity from RG&E at the market based 
backout credit which will be determined 15 days prior to the beginning of 
each of the two six-month capability periods, and will be based on ""a 
forecast of energy prices derived from Enron Corporation's (Enron) 
EnronOnline trading platform.""  To my knowledge, this is the first occasion 
that a regulatory body has agreed to use Enron Online as an index!  LSEs can 
elect instead to procure their own commodity and get a market-based backout 
credit (MBBC). Under this option, the LSEs will get a market based backout 
credit. However, the Enron online prices for the six months determined as 
above will be reconciled on a lag basis against actual market prices.  The 
PSC has capped the amount of the reconciliation for any LSE to the product of 
the LSE's total load for the calendar year and $0.065 per kwh (PSC staff's 
estimate of RG&E's embedded power supply cost).  (The PSC Order actually says 
$0.015 but this appears to be a mistake since the attached settlement states 
$0.065.) A copy of the PSC's Order is available on its website:

I decided to wait until after Christmas to respond to your letter.

I have drafted an amended petition which adds Randy, Steve, and Enron as
defendants.  Among other matters, the petition includes tort claims arising
from acts of slander, fraud, and tortious interference with contract.

You have been critical of my decision to file the original petition in
September because, as I understand it, you believed that I had failed to
exhaust other avenues for redress.  I believe that every other potential
means of resolution had been exhausted.  However, in respect for your offer
of constructive criticism, I would like to once again extend an offer for
mediation in an attempt to resolve the ECOGAS matter, and now these matters.

I called your office and understand that you are not in today.  As I
anticipate that you may be on vacation this week, I will wait until next
week before proceeding with any new filings.

Please contact me if mediation is of any interest to your client.  If it
won't be you, please let me know if you happen to know who will be
representing the additional defendants.

Best regards,
Tom

I decided to wait until after Christmas to respond to your letter.

I have drafted an amended petition which adds Randy, Steve, and Enron as
defendants.  Among other matters, the petition includes tort claims arising
from acts of slander, fraud, and tortious interference with contract.

You have been critical of my decision to file the original petition in
September because, as I understand it, you believed that I had failed to
exhaust other avenues for redress.  I believe that every other potential
means of resolution had been exhausted.  However, in respect for your offer
of constructive criticism, I would like to once again extend an offer for
mediation in an attempt to resolve the ECOGAS matter, and now these matters.

I called your office and understand that you are not in today.  As I
anticipate that you may be on vacation this week, I will wait until next
week before proceeding with any new filings.

Please contact me if mediation is of any interest to your client.  If it
won't be you, please let me know if you happen to know who will be
representing the additional defendants.

Best regards,
Tom

Attached is the Opposition of the City and County of San Francisco to the

the issues raised in the Opposition.  I will subsequently e-mail suggested

once you receive them, please finalize the declarations and fax them back to

Subject: Re: Glencore AG
Tanya/Sara/Tom:
I spoke with David Porter, the credit person at Glencore Ltd., last Friday 
and inquired about Glencore AG's relation to Glencore Ltd., with which we 
have a master swap.  He indicated to me quite emphatically that Glencore 
Ltd., Glencore AG, and Glencore SA are one in the same.  He explained that 
when documents of incorporation were filed with the country of Switzerland, 
this one corporation registered three names which it uses to do business on a 
regional basis.  He faxed over some documents to that effect.  He indicated 
that while Glencore Ltd., the branch arm doing business here in the states 
has the master, the master should cover Glencore AG, since it is the same 
company only the European branch.  He has even offered to work on an 
amendment to the master to cover the addition of the second name, Glencore 
AG..
Sara, I will send you the documentation that David Porter faxed me.  Please 
let me know your opinion of the information contained.

Subject: Additional ""Authorized Trader"" for equity account
Sheila Glover has requested that David Vitrella be designated as a second 
""Authorized Trader"" for the Enron Communications Investments Corp. account 
which was recently opened with Morgan (having as its purpose the sale of 
Rhythms stock).  The rationale for a second trader is not new to us:  in John 
Greene's absence, no one is authorized to trade in that account.  It is my

this particular stock which will be ""dribbled in"" periodically.  Please let

Cargill for many months.  It appears that we had subaccounts for trading 
crude, nat gas, unleaded gas.  We do not have any margin residing with

an executed agreement, ENA and BP continue to use a form of ""Swap Contract""

which also provides that the parties will negotiate a master agreement.   Rod 
doesn't see much current trading activity so we didn't believe this to be a

involved.  Our counterparties are telling us that they prefer to look to 
Enron Corp. since it is Enron Corp.'s stock that is involved.  At a minimun, 
even if ENA were the trading counterparty (with an Enron Corp. guaranty

Subject: Proprietary Debt Trading Books from ECT Investments, Inc. to Enron 
North America

Alan and Sara,
Last Wednesday we met to discuss the change of organization structure for the 
two Proprietary Debt Trading Books, Credit and Convertible, from ECT 
Investments, Inc. to Enron North America.  

As a follow-up to our discussion, the attached document details the accounts 
maintained at prime brokers and OTC Swaps currently in place for these two 
books.

My initial discussions with the three prime brokers have indicated to change 
the account name, from ECTI to ENA, and the related tax ID will require an 
Assignment and Assumption Letter.

Please let me know if anything else is required.
Thanks. Sheila

With respect to our recent exchange of voice-mail messages,
I await to receive from you at your earliest opportunity
a draft of the Amendment to the Credit Support Annex between

I have also been advised by our Credit Department that we are
to begin negotiations on an ISDA Master Agreement between Enron

		 Subject: Project Cerberus - amended to introduce the swap counterparty 
Rabobank (""Rabo"")

Tanya:

Enron Corp, (global finance) has a FASB 125 structured deal executed in Dec., 
2000 which requires amendment for tax purposes.  A new  total return equity 
swap on EOG stock will need to be executed between ENA and Rabo.  ENA must be 
the swap counterparty (""normal course of business"") for the legal opinion 
which must be issued for the structure.  I would like to send Rabo our ISDA 
format so as to avoid any surprises; time is short.  I assume we do not want 
a CSA but will require an Enron Corp. guaranty.  Do we want cross default and 
Credit Event Upon Merger to apply to the parties?   Do we want to 
add/eliminate additional events of default?  The ultimate Schedule will 
probably look very different from our standard but we need to urge our format 
as much as possible.  

Please call me to update.  This update is currently scheduled to close next 
Friday.  Thanks.  Sara

On the thresholds, I will agree to their matrix with one change for BBB-.  
Revised looks like this:

25MM AAA
20MM A or above
15MM BBB+ or above
10MM BBB
5MM BBB-
0 below BBB-

Rounding at 10K is fine.  I would prefer to leave our Min Trf amount the way 
it is (only changes the threshold, in effect).  Or, I am amenable to one 
amount for everyone (say 100K instead of our 0).

Do I need to look at Inser B and C?

I spoke with Sheryl Gallant.  ENA and other Enron affiliates are already 
trading on the UBS electronic websites for OTC transactions.  Interestingly 
enough, UBS does not require an electronic trading agreement to be signed by 
a customer for online trading.  In other words, ENA has an executed ISDA with 
UBS dated May 31, 1993, you are an authorized trader for ENA and UBS is happy 
to let you access their platform. Sheryl does not know why Jun Ishi requested 
execution of a ""Client User List"" (i.e., an authorized trader list) and said 
to forget it.  If you would like for me to speak to Jun Ishi or correspond 
with him (please send his email address), just let me know.

Please let me hear from you if you would like for me to pursue further.  As a 
representative of ENA, you will probably have most agreements already in 
place.

Denis:

I will initial the Security Agreement for you and have it executed.  Where do 
you want the executed documents sent?

As you know, all of our master agreements (whether or not related to 
structured deals) are logged into our Lotus Notes database to which London 
has access.  Please provide me with a list and copies of the ISDA Master 
Agreements (and/or related financial agreements) which have been executed by 
London  in the name of ENA.  These agreements should also be logged onto the 
ENA database.    

Will these masters be assigned to Enron Credit Inc.?  Will all trades be 
assigned?  If so, will you prepare the assignment for execution?

Thanks.

stock.  There is a renewed effort coming from Treasury to use these tools 
more frequently than in the past.  I am in touch with Rex Rogers (Enron Corp. 
securities lawyer) as registration rights issues on ENE stock are definitely 
involved.  Our counterparties are telling us that they prefer to look to 
Enron Corp. since it is Enron Corp.'s stock that is involved.  At a minimun, 
even if ENA were the trading counterparty (with an Enron Corp. guaranty 
capped at an appropriate level), Enron Corp. would probably have to sign each

Denis:

I will initial the Security Agreement for you and have it executed.  Where do 
you want the executed documents sent?

As you know, all of our master agreements (whether or not related to 
structured deals) are logged into our Lotus Notes database to which London 
has access.  Please provide me with a list and copies of the ISDA Master 
Agreements (and/or related financial agreements) which have been executed by 
London  in the name of ENA.  These agreements should also be logged onto the 
ENA database.    

Will these masters be assigned to Enron Credit Inc.?  Will all trades be 
assigned?  If so, will you prepare the assignment for execution?

Thanks.

(1)  Goldman Sachs
ENA  executed the Client Access Agreement with Goldman, Sachs & Co.  on June 
15, 2000.  Since you are trading in the name of ENA, you should not need to 
execute an additional agreement.  I confirmed this with Ted Leh this 
morning.  At Ted's suggestion, please forward to me the fax number and email 
address of the Goldman person requesting that you execute further 
documentation.  I can fax to him a copy of the agreement and correspond by 
email.  I will also copy Ted Leh and Vivian Siao (keeps track of agreements 
and authorized traders) so that everyone is up to date.

(2)  UBS Warburg
I spoke with Sheryl Gallant.  ENA and other Enron affiliates are already 
trading on the UBS electronic websites for OTC transactions.  Interestingly 
enough, UBS does not require an electronic trading agreement to be signed by 
a customer for online trading.  In other words, ENA has an executed ISDA with 
UBS dated May 31, 1993, you are an authorized trader for ENA and UBS is happy 
to let you access their platform. Sheryl does not know why Jun Ishi requested 
execution of a ""Client User List"" (i.e., an authorized trader list) and said 
to forget it.  If you would like for me to speak to Jun Ishi or correspond 
with him (please send his email address), just let me know.

Please let me hear from you if you would like for me to pursue further.  As a 
representative of ENA, you will probably have most agreements already in 
place.

Dear Sara,

With respect to our recent exchange of voice-mail messages,
I await to receive from you at your earliest opportunity
a draft of the Amendment to the Credit Support Annex between
Enron North America Corp. and Cargill, Incorporated.

I have also been advised by our Credit Department that we are
to begin negotiations on an ISDA Master Agreement between Enron
North America Corp. and Cargill-Alliant, LLC.  We assume the
ISDA being amended above would serve as a basis for this new
Agreement.  Could you please advise if you will also be handling
negotiation of the Cargill-Alliant, LLC ISDA?

I'll be in NYC on business this week, starting tomorrow. 

Sara and I visited on this matter the end of last week. Sara was going to 
check with the Credit Trading desk regarding a few follow-up questions we had 
on the swap description list. For example, the list did not indicate which 
Enron entity was the party to each of the transactions, so we can determine 
if an assignment needs to be prepared. Also, did any of the prime brokers 
indicate any particular form of Assignment and Assumption Agreement that they 
wished to see from us?

Alan and Sara,
Last Wednesday we met to discuss the change of organization structure for the 
two Proprietary Debt Trading Books, Credit and Convertible, from ECT 
Investments, Inc. to Enron North America.  

As a follow-up to our discussion, the attached document details the accounts 
maintained at prime brokers and OTC Swaps currently in place for these two 
books.

My initial discussions with the three prime brokers have indicated to change 
the account name, from ECTI to ENA, and the related tax ID will require an 
Assignment and Assumption Letter.

Please let me know if anything else is required.
Thanks. Sheila

Subject: Additional ""Authorized Trader"" for equity account
Sheila Glover has requested that David Vitrella be designated as a second 
""Authorized Trader"" for the Enron Communications Investments Corp. account 
which was recently opened with Morgan (having as its purpose the sale of 
Rhythms stock).  The rationale for a second trader is not new to us:  in John 
Greene's absence, no one is authorized to trade in that account.  It is my 
understanding that the only activity to occur in this account is the sale of 
this particular stock which will be ""dribbled in"" periodically.  Please let 
me know if you have any questions.  Both Donna and Sheila are very familiar 
with this transaction.  Sara

		 Subject: Project Cerberus - amended to introduce the swap counterparty 
Rabobank (""Rabo"")

Tanya:

Enron Corp, (global finance) has a FASB 125 structured deal executed in Dec., 
2000 which requires amendment for tax purposes.  A new  total return equity 
swap on EOG stock will need to be executed between ENA and Rabo.  ENA must be 
the swap counterparty (""normal course of business"") for the legal opinion 
which must be issued for the structure.  I would like to send Rabo our ISDA 
format so as to avoid any surprises; time is short.  I assume we do not want 
a CSA but will require an Enron Corp. guaranty.  Do we want cross default and 
Credit Event Upon Merger to apply to the parties?   Do we want to 
add/eliminate additional events of default?  The ultimate Schedule will 
probably look very different from our standard but we need to urge our format 
as much as possible.  

Please call me to update.  This update is currently scheduled to close next 
Friday.  Thanks.  Sara

We finally agreed on the guaranty form (the cap is $25 million) and are about 
ready to execute the actual agreement.  I have one question:  in the ISDA 
world, we use ""cost of funds plus 1%"" as the default interest rate.  The Bear 
document provides:

""...interest thereon at a rate equal to (A) in the case of purchases of 
Foreign Securities, LIBOR, (B) in the case of purchases of any other 
securities (or other amounts, if any, due to Lender hereunder), the Federal 
Funds Rate or (C) such other rate as may be specified in Schedule B, in each 
case as such rate fluctuates from day to day, from the date of such purchase 
until the date of payment of such excess.""

What is your preference:  Bear's standard language or do you want to specify 
another rate?

 During my assessment of your machine, I noted your current hardware 
configuration:
SP750 with Dual 800Mhz PIII processors
512MB RAM
Matrox Quad video card

We currently do not have hardware in stock that matches these 
specifications.  Our current practice is to prepare a machine that is like or 
better than the machine the customer has currently, then swap that hardware.  
The benefits here are minimal downtime and the ability to switch back to the 
old machine quickly if an application does not work correctly in Windows 
2000.  Because we do not have a machine of equal or greater speed in stock, 
here is what I propose:

Every machine we migrate is Ghosted.  By this, I mean we run a program called 
Ghost which takes a snapshot of the machine in its current state.  This image 
can then be put back on the machine or accessed to retrieve files or other 
data.  I propose we Ghost your existing machine, make a backup copy of that 
image (after verifying it works correctly), then re-use your current hardware 
with Windows 2000.  The risk here is that we cannot go back to Windows NT 
(your current system) as quickly if something does not work.  

If you would like to move ahead with this plan, please let me know.  
Otherwise, we will order a machine with the same specifications, but it will 
take some time to get here.

I look forward to hearing from you.

As you know, Enron has been working diligently to further its relationship 
with Wharton.  We have recently been asked and have committed to provide a 
speaker for the Wharton Fellows in e-Business conference on the morning of 
January 11th in the San Francisco area.  

We are, of course, in need of a high level speaker from Enron who can speak 
with expertise to the topic of Enron's evolution as a company (from gas 
pipelines to financial products and beyond).  

Are you available?  A Wharton grad with your background would be a stand-out 
contribution to the program.  

I have more detailed information regarding the program and the attendees for 
your review.  Please let me know if you can fit this into your schedule.

my name is Brando Hayden and I am a trader and second year Associate on the 
Weather Derivatives desk.  Mark Tawney, my supervisor, has made a few 
attempts to set up a meeting for the three of us to discuss a few issues 
involving my performance and status in the group.  I believe that I have 
applied myself over the last seventeen months to produce significant results 
in my book and for the group.   My portfolio is up $6.7M YTD (12/17/00) which 
represents a significant contribution to the group's total revenues this 
year.  The issue here is that despite this significant contribution among 
other contributions to the group my performance has been portrayed in the PRC 
process as sub-standard and worthy of demotion.  I do not believe that this 
is just and would like to get this issue addressed.  As a result I would like 
to set up an appointment to speak with you about this matter.

I have attached a report of my trading performance through 12/17/00 for your

to execute on behalf of their customers on EnronOnline.  Below are the terms 
of these transactions as outlined in the LOI's.  I have contacted many of the 
desk heads prior to entering into the LOI's and outlined the general terms of 
these transactions (J Arnold, J Nowlan, K McGowan, U Ek, S Hastings, K 
Presto,J Hawthorn).  We are also in discussions with the following brokers E 
D & F Man (US Gas and US Power), GFI (global gas, power, coal and emissions), 
PVM (European Crude and Products), and Prebon (world-wide gas & power).  We 
would appreciate if you could give us the names of additional brokers we 
could talk to that are active in your products.
Please pay particular attention to the Amerex terms which include the ability 
to initiate executions telephonically using website prices.  Enrons 
obligation to transact telephonically on website prices are good faith only.  
This term allows Amerex to get around a exclusivity clause with Altra which 
they are trying to negotiate out of.
Please review the terms and contact me at (ext 3-0397) concerning any 
comments or concerns that need to be addressed prior to the execution of 
definitive agreements.

As you know, Enron has been working diligently to further its relationship 
with Wharton.  We have recently been asked and have committed to provide a 
speaker for the Wharton Fellows in e-Business conference on the morning of 
January 11th in the San Francisco area.  

We are, of course, in need of a high level speaker from Enron who can speak 
with expertise to the topic of Enron's evolution as a company (from gas 
pipelines to financial products and beyond).  

Are you available?  A Wharton grad with your background would be a stand-out 
contribution to the program.  

I have more detailed information regarding the program and the attendees for 
your review.  Please let me know if you can fit this into your schedule.

Thanks.

my name is Brando Hayden and I am a trader and second year Associate on the 
Weather Derivatives desk.  Mark Tawney, my supervisor, has made a few 
attempts to set up a meeting for the three of us to discuss a few issues 
involving my performance and status in the group.  I believe that I have 
applied myself over the last seventeen months to produce significant results 
in my book and for the group.   My portfolio is up $6.7M YTD (12/17/00) which 
represents a significant contribution to the group's total revenues this 
year.  The issue here is that despite this significant contribution among 
other contributions to the group my performance has been portrayed in the PRC 
process as sub-standard and worthy of demotion.  I do not believe that this 
is just and would like to get this issue addressed.  As a result I would like 
to set up an appointment to speak with you about this matter.

I have attached a report of my trading performance through 12/17/00 for your

Subject:  JDS Uniphase Corporation Strongly Supports
      Retention of Direct Access and asks for CPUC Support

Dear Commissioner Geoffrey F. Brown:

My name is Kenneth D. Pietrelli, Vice President of Corporate Services for the
Thin Film Products Group(formerly OCLI and Flex Products) of JDS Uniphase in
Santa Rosa, California.  I am asking for your support to retain Direct Access 
as
an option for industrial energy customers such as JDS Uniphase.  Electricity 
and
natural gas are critical infrastructural requirements for our manufacturing
processes.  Without access to reliable sources, at high quality and 
competitive
prices we cannot satisfy our customers needs and be a viable business in
California.  We fear loss of direct access will have a material, adverse 
effect
on our business in California where we currently employ approximately 5,000
employees. JDS Uniphase is made up of such diverse groups as the original
Uniphase Commercial Lasers Group in San Jose and Manteca, the E-Tek Dynamics
Company in San Jose, SDLI in San Jose and Santa Clara and OCLI and Flex 
Products
in Santa Rosa.  The corporation has over 20,000 employees in over 20 
countries.
Of all the sites in California only the Santa Rosa site has direct access, 
which
is due to various historical and operational reasons.  We own a 22Mw 
substation
located on our 75 acre plant site and are considered a grid level customer.  
Up
to now we have enjoyed high quality, reliable electrical energy.  In the mid
1990's we began contracting directly for natural gas from other than PG& E and
are currently sourcing gas from Pan Canadian Energy via a single point gas 
meter
for the site.  In 1998 we entered into a 5 year direct access electricity
contract with PG& E Energy Services.  In 2000 this contract was assigned by 
PG&E
Energy Services to Enron and is valid through June 30, 2003.   Because of the
importance of energy availability, quality and price to our manufacturing
operations we have made business decisions on where capital investments have
been made and where redundant operations would be consolidated.  We are in the
process of a global re-alignment program that is consolidating numerous
activities to Santa Rosa, CA for a variety of reasons, to include our direct
access to energy.

 If direct access is eliminated in California, JDS Uniphase management will 
have
to re-assess and re-consider actions currently underway to consolidate
manufacturing from Rochester, NY; Ottawa, Canada; Dunfermline Fife, Scotland;
and San Jose, Ca to the Santa Rosa, CA site. Other locations on the East Coast
of the U.S., China, UK, etc. would have to be re-considered for these
consolidation activities.  Selfishly, we are asking you to retain direct 
access
to keep jobs in California.  Philosophically, we believe the ""right to choose""
is an American tradition and anyone concerned with the long-term health and
viability of the California economy would want to retain the direct access
option for California customers.   Thanks for your time and support.

-11940.0,"Have you had the chance to put together a template for ENA's manual 
confirmations of PGL's election to change their supply contract price under 
the flexible pricing provision?  It is important for their accounting 
treatment and compliance with their risk management policy that these 
confirmation reflect a changed physical deal not a new financial swap. 

Per Daron Giron, the preferred way to book these transactions in the Aruba 
book is to unwind the existing index sale and rebook the physical fix price 
sale.  

ENA would also like to add a disclaimer on the bottom of the confirmation 
that states something to the effect that decision to trigger these fix prices 
was PGL's decision and ENA didn't advise or recommend this transaction.  Jeff 
Hodge is working on what the actual language should say.  Let me know when 
you think you might have this template available.  I want to show PGL what to 
expect from ENA once they start triggering fix prices.  Thanks

FYI, Mark Taylor has been working on the broker access project.  I think that 
the structure of these deals may ultimately differ from the structure 
described in the LOI and term sheet, but I'm not sure what the current 
thinking is on the structure right now.  I do know that some more thought has 
been put into the broker access concept since we developed the Natsource LOI 
(upon which the other two were based), and that we have never gone back to 
the Natsource LOI to make sure that it represented ""the deal.""

The LOIs/Term sheets on these deals are non-binding, so I don't think there 
is any material legal exposure for sending them out and starting discussions 
with these counterparties.  However, I think that when Mark Taylor returns, 
we need to put our heads together and make sure that these proposals match up 
with how we our current thinking on these structures.  If there is a big 
difference, we can talk about approaching our counterparties on these LOIs 
and explaining our new approach.

The following comments are with respect to all Basis Swap product 
descriptions on the DynegyDirect trading web site.

1.  The reference to the ""fixed price"" is incorrect as it references the 
basis spread price specified on the trading screen rather than the second 
floating price which should be one of the NYMEX futures contracts.  This is a 
structural error that was carried through all the basis swap definitions and 
should be fixed to avoid ambiguity or future arguments over what was 
intended. 

2.  In the new definition of ""fixed price""  all references should be made to 
either the NYMEX Henry Hub or Permian Basin futures contracts for the 
applicable Determination Period rather than to the ""appropriate NYMEX futures 
contract"".   Otherwise it will not be clear which natural gas futures 
contract is being referred to.

3.  While there is a default definition in the Master Agreement it would be 
preferable to define ""Determination Period"" in the product description by 
adding the following sentence, ""Each calendar month during the term of the 
Transaction will be a Determination Period.""

4.  The sentence specifying the definition of the ""Price"" should specify that 
the ""Price is the differential between the Floating Price and the Fixed Price 
(or Fixed Price and the Floating Price).  

5.  The sentence relating to payment dates should specify that the amounts 
owed should be paid no later than ""five business days after the Floating 
Price and the Fixed Price are published.""

 I would suggest that Dynegy borrow the language from our long product 
descriptions on EOL. 



The following comments are with respect to the  ""FP Swap NYMEX"" product 
descriptions.

1.  In the definition of the ""floating price"" all references should be made 
to either the NYMEX Henry Hub or Permian Basin futures contract for the 
applicable Determination Period rather than to the ""appropriate NYMEX futures 
contract"".   It is not clear which natural gas futures contract is being 
referenced.

2.  While there is a default definition in the Master Agreement it would be 
preferable to define ""Determination Period"" in the product description by 
adding the following sentence, ""Each calendar month during the term of the 
Transaction will be a Determination Period.""



As we do not have a master agreement in place with Dynegy Liquids Marketing & 
Trade I would not approve trading in the liquids financial products including 
the ""C2 Swap Fix OPIS C2 MON"" and ""NC4ISO Swap Fix OPIS NON MON"" products 
until either a master is agreed to or the GTC form of master is approved.  
Please let us know if the commercial team wants to pursue trading these 
products.


Bob has agreed to review the definitions of the floating prices to ensure 
that they correctly identify the floating price sources.  I will forward him 
copies of the long form descriptions today.  Other than having Bob check the 
floating price source language I do not have any comments on the two 
swingswap definitions.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
Regards,
Brent

thinking is on the structure right now.  I do know that some more thought has 
been put into the broker access concept since we developed the Natsource LOI 
(upon which the other two were based), and that we have never gone back to 
the Natsource LOI to make sure that it represented ""the deal.""

The LOIs/Term sheets on these deals are non-binding, so I don't think there 
is any material legal exposure for sending them out and starting discussions 
with these counterparties.  However, I think that when Mark Taylor returns, 
we need to put our heads together and make sure that these proposals match up 
with how we our current thinking on these structures.  If there is a big 
difference, we can talk about approaching our counterparties on these LOIs 
and explaining our new approach.

The following comments are with respect to all Basis Swap product 
descriptions on the DynegyDirect trading web site.

1.  The reference to the ""fixed price"" is incorrect as it references the 
basis spread price specified on the trading screen rather than the second 
floating price which should be one of the NYMEX futures contracts.  This is a 
structural error that was carried through all the basis swap definitions and 
should be fixed to avoid ambiguity or future arguments over what was 
intended. 

2.  In the new definition of ""fixed price""  all references should be made to 
either the NYMEX Henry Hub or Permian Basin futures contracts for the 
applicable Determination Period rather than to the ""appropriate NYMEX futures 
contract"".   Otherwise it will not be clear which natural gas futures 
contract is being referred to.

3.  While there is a default definition in the Master Agreement it would be 
preferable to define ""Determination Period"" in the product description by 
adding the following sentence, ""Each calendar month during the term of the 
Transaction will be a Determination Period.""

4.  The sentence specifying the definition of the ""Price"" should specify that 
the ""Price is the differential between the Floating Price and the Fixed Price 
(or Fixed Price and the Floating Price).  

5.  The sentence relating to payment dates should specify that the amounts 
owed should be paid no later than ""five business days after the Floating 
Price and the Fixed Price are published.""

 I would suggest that Dynegy borrow the language from our long product 
descriptions on EOL.

Comments are due on Thursday, May 17, 2001.

We would like to meet with you to make sure our comments address the 
commercial concerns regarding the reallocation plan. In that regard, please 
plan to attend a meeting on Thursday, May 3 at 3:45 in 3269.  Becky will 
provide for your review a summary of El Paso's proposal.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks

Stephanie

Jeff and I have spent some time discussing Sempra issues and decided to use 
the meeting delay as an opportunity to develop some power price structures 
that may be interesting to them. This is all driven by PG&E's recent move to 
fix prices for upwards of 1,000 MW's.  The pressure will be on SDG&E and SCE 
to do likewise.

 I will be in Portland on Monday and hope to get some time with you to 
discuss this but wanted to provide you with a preview.

Jeff and I discussed some structures that might be attractive to Sempra given 
the regulatory and shareholder risk they face should they (1) continue to buy 
power at market prices and/or (2) lock in a fixed price: 
(a) costless collar,
(b) fixed price coupled with writing long-dated puts, and 
(c) price cap.

These structures are intended to address Sempra's risk exposure.  Our 
underlying understanding is:
1)  Continued purchases @ market exposes Sempra to substantial regulatory and 
shareholder risk,
2)  Fixing the price mitigates both of these risks,
3)  A costless collar arguably keeps Sempra in the market limiting their 
exposure to higher prices but allowing them to benefit from lower prices,
4)  Writing the put generates a premium which can be applied to lower a fixed 
price, and
5)  Holding a call eliminates their exposure to high prices and allows them 
to benefit from lower prices.

With that said, I expect the cost of the call to be huge.  However, the 
costless collar and fixed price with a put could be attractive.  The only 
problem with collars is that our bid-offer spread typically skews the band 
such that if the underlying price were $50, a cap with a $70 strike would be 
associated with a $40 strike on the put.

Our thought was to get some notional prices and but together a few plots to 
illustrate how these products work.
 
What do you think?

Subject:  JDS Uniphase Corporation Strongly Supports
      Retention of Direct Access and asks for CPUC Support

Dear Commissioner Geoffrey F. Brown:

My name is Kenneth D. Pietrelli, Vice President of Corporate Services for the
Thin Film Products Group(formerly OCLI and Flex Products) of JDS Uniphase in
Santa Rosa, California.  I am asking for your support to retain Direct Access 
as
an option for industrial energy customers such as JDS Uniphase.  Electricity 
and
natural gas are critical infrastructural requirements for our manufacturing
processes.  Without access to reliable sources, at high quality and 
competitive
prices we cannot satisfy our customers needs and be a viable business in
California.  We fear loss of direct access will have a material, adverse 
effect
on our business in California where we currently employ approximately 5,000
employees. JDS Uniphase is made up of such diverse groups as the original
Uniphase Commercial Lasers Group in San Jose and Manteca, the E-Tek Dynamics
Company in San Jose, SDLI in San Jose and Santa Clara and OCLI and Flex 
Products
in Santa Rosa.  The corporation has over 20,000 employees in over 20 
countries.
Of all the sites in California only the Santa Rosa site has direct access, 
which
is due to various historical and operational reasons.  We own a 22Mw 
substation
located on our 75 acre plant site and are considered a grid level customer.  
Up
to now we have enjoyed high quality, reliable electrical energy.  In the mid
1990's we began contracting directly for natural gas from other than PG& E and
are currently sourcing gas from Pan Canadian Energy via a single point gas 
meter
for the site.  In 1998 we entered into a 5 year direct access electricity
contract with PG& E Energy Services.  In 2000 this contract was assigned by 
PG&E
Energy Services to Enron and is valid through June 30, 2003.   Because of the
importance of energy availability, quality and price to our manufacturing
operations we have made business decisions on where capital investments have
been made and where redundant operations would be consolidated.  We are in the
process of a global re-alignment program that is consolidating numerous
activities to Santa Rosa, CA for a variety of reasons, to include our direct
access to energy.

 If direct access is eliminated in California, JDS Uniphase management will 
have
to re-assess and re-consider actions currently underway to consolidate
manufacturing from Rochester, NY; Ottawa, Canada; Dunfermline Fife, Scotland;
and San Jose, Ca to the Santa Rosa, CA site. Other locations on the East Coast
of the U.S., China, UK, etc. would have to be re-considered for these
consolidation activities.  Selfishly, we are asking you to retain direct 
access
to keep jobs in California.  Philosophically, we believe the ""right to choose""
is an American tradition and anyone concerned with the long-term health and
viability of the California economy would want to retain the direct access
option for California customers.   Thanks for your time and support.

Subject: More Info: PG&E to Announce Open Season on Redwood and Baja Early 
Next Week

PG&E will announce via press release very early next week an open season on 
Redwood, Baja and Silverado.
It comes in direct response to recent announcements of expansions into 
California by pipelines.
The bid protocols will be structured similar to original open season from the 
original Gas Accord.
The open season will start on June 1 and end on July 31.
Capacity will be available starting 1.1.03.
Bidders will be able to bid up to 30 years (PG&E states that that's what 
generators want).
Accompanying the announcement will be another announcement that PG&E will 
expand Redwood by 200mmcf/day, which they hope to have available by 1.1.03, 
or some time during Q103.
About 2-4 weeks after the open season begins, PG&E will file its proposed 
""Gas Accord II,""  (the first one expires end of 02).
As part of that filing, PG&E will offer its proposed ratemaking treatment for 
the next five years (beginning 1.1.03).
PG&E will not include in the open season 1) core capacity and 2) certain EAD 
contracts that extend beyond the Gas Accord 1 end date.
In addition, PG&E will hold back an additional 20% (after excluding core and 
EAD), to be ""open-seasoned"" at some ""future"" date.
The capacity to be auctioned is: 1) 900 mmcf/day on Redwood, 2) 245 (annual) 
on Baja, plus an additional 200/day in summer on Baja, 3) 155 on Silverado.
How PG&E will market the 20% they intend to hold back, and when they might 
auction it off in the future will be discussed in PG&E's Gas Accord II filing.
No single company will be awarded more than 30% of the capacity on any 
specific path in the primary open season (though firms can bid whatever level 
of capacity they choose).

Please forwad along to anyone else who might be interested.  If you have any 
questions, just holler.

Best,
Jeff

Greetings Piper:

My name is Jeff Dasovich.  I'm in Enron's San Francisco office.  I think
you've spoken with Karen Denne.  Scott asked for some background materials
on our proposed solution to California's electricity crisis.  I'll be
forwarding those to you sometime between 5 and 6 PM PDT.  Does that work

Subject: Summary of Weekend events:
Governor, Utility In War Of Words--Davis furious as PG&E defends bankruptcy 
filing 

This pretty much summarizes the events over the weekend resulting from PG&E's 
filing on Monday--more stellar leadership from the administration.
Biggest news is that the Governor is now frantically trying to cobble 
together a Tx buy-out deal with Edison & Sempra; but note that Burton in this 
story questions whether it makes sense to buy Tx if PG&E isn't part of the 
deal.
The first hearing on the bankruptcy is today.

Governor, Utility In War Of Words 
Davis furious as PG&E defends bankruptcy filing

N223519.DTL 
California's energy mess took an ugly turn yesterday as Gov. Gray Davis and 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. traded barbs over who is to blame for the 
bankruptcy of the state's largest utility. 
In a series of tit-for-tat statements, each side laid claim to the moral high 
ground while insisting that the other had been dealing in bad faith. 
The governor spent part of his time yesterday giving television interviews in 
response to The Chronicle's report Saturday that PG&E awarded $50 million in 
bonuses and raises to 6,000 employees just hours before Friday's bankruptcy 
filing. 
""PG&E's management is suffering from two afflictions: denial and greed,"" 
Davis said in a brief statement Saturday night. 
In a testy reply, PG&E countered that ""instead of focusing all his attention 
on solving the state's yearlong and ever-worsening energy crisis, the 
governor has launched a campaign-style attack on our company."" 
PG&E said Davis was criticizing ""thousands of men and women who have worked 
tirelessly and professionally through this crisis"" and concluded that 
""California would be far better served if the governor turned his attention 
to the crisis at hand."" 
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, fired back yesterday: ""PG&E 
waged a public relations war on Friday. If they're looking for somebody to 
blame, they should look in the mirror."" 
Maviglio also said the governor was concentrating on reaching a final accord 
with Southern California Edison Co. for the state to purchase the cash- 
strapped company's power lines for nearly $2.8 billion. 
A last round of talks was scheduled to be held last night. 
""There are a few remaining details to be worked out, but it seems pretty 
close,"" Maviglio said, adding that an announcement of the deal could come as 
early as today. 
""The governor is spending his time negotiating with a responsible utility,"" 
he said. 
Along with the Edison deal, Davis spent the weekend huddling with energy 
advisers and lawyers trying to come up with an appropriate response to PG&E's 
bankruptcy bombshell. 
Efforts to stabilize California's dysfunctional electricity market suddenly 
have become much more complex. 
NOT MUCH CHANGED
Nevertheless, while PG&E's bankruptcy is by far the most sensational aspect 
of California's long-drawn-out energy mess, at the end of the day, it doesn't 
really change a thing. 
Consider: 
-- PG&E's financial woes stem from a rate freeze that prevented the utility 
from passing along to customers runaway wholesale power costs. That rate 
freeze and sky-high electricity prices remain in place. 
-- California's energy shortage is primarily the result of the state not 
having built any major power plants for the past 12 years. PG&E's bankruptcy 
does nothing to affect that precarious situation. 
-- PG&E's foray into bankruptcy court does not alter the fact that 
electricity demand is outpacing available supply. California consumers still 
face a threat of daily blackouts when power usage spikes this summer. 
""The crux of the problem is still the same,"" said Loretta Lynch, president of 
the state Public Utilities Commission. ""We face the same challenges we did 
before PG&E filed for bankruptcy."" 
She added, however, that PG&E's bankruptcy ""increases the uncertainty."" 
The utility doesn't see it that way. 
PG&E spokesman Ron Low said California's energy woes are no more uncertain 
now than they were when the company ostensibly was negotiating with Davis to 
find an equitable solution to the state's troubles. 
""California remains in an energy crisis,"" he said. ""As we head toward summer, 
resources are going to be very tight."" 
WHAT COULD HAPPEN
In the short run, consumers will notice no change whatsoever. Bankruptcy 
protection will allow PG&E to continue operating as usual while the company's 
creditors line up to receive at least partial payment of outstanding bills. 
Longer term, there is a very real possibility that electricity rates will 
soar if the bankruptcy judge agrees with PG&E that conditions for lifting the 
rate freeze were met a year ago and that $9 billion in subsequent expenses 
must be borne by consumers. 
How much people's bills would rise depends on how the rate increase is 
structured. It would probably come in the form of a surcharge on existing 
fees, 
but the monthly hit to consumers could be limited by spreading the total cost 
over a number of years. 
The big question mark now is how PG&E's bankruptcy will affect various 
political and legislative measures intended to keep California's lights on. 
The state's attempt to purchase PG&E's power lines is obviously finished, 
although a new deal could be negotiated in bankruptcy court. 
Meanwhile, the governor is pressing ahead with plans to purchase the 
transmission systems of Edison and Sempra Energy's San Diego utility -- 
although what the state would do with only a partial power grid has yet to be 
determined. 
""Does it make any sense to have the transmission lines of Edison and Sempra 
and not PG&E?"" asked state Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San 
Francisco. ""I don't know the answer to that."" 
A final accord with Edison this week would validate PG&E's apparent concerns 
that it would have had a harder time limiting backlash to its bankruptcy 
filing if the utility had acted after a breakthrough with Edison was 
unveiled. 
The Chronicle quoted PG&E insiders yesterday as saying that the decision to 
file for bankruptcy had been made early last week, even though senior company 
officials said the move followed the governor's Thursday night speech on 
solving California's energy issues. 
One reason PG&E opted to file on Friday morning was because a final deal with 
Edison was expected at any time, observers said. 
Paul Patterson, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston, noted that if PG&E 
had filed for bankruptcy after Edison came to terms with the state, ""they 
would be seen as a spoiler."" 
ENSUING CONFUSION
In any case, PG&E's surprise filing has left all concerned scrambling for 
footing in the changed political landscape. 
Consumer advocates watched with dismay yesterday as the state's political and 
corporate powers slugged it out for supremacy. 
Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network in San 
Francisco, said all this finger-pointing will do nothing to ensure that 
Californians have ample supplies of electricity this summer. 
""These guys should grow up and come up with a situation that works for the 
public,"" she said.

Quick Update

On the various matters currently before the California PUC:
The Commission order stating that the utilities should absorb any difference 
between DWR's cost of power and the retail rate freeze is still technically 
in effect.  (The order only applies, however, to the power purchased under 
the Governor's emergency order giving the State the authority to buy power.)
The utilities have petitioned to modify the decision telling the Commission 
that the easiest way to remedy the problem would be to vacate the order 
altogether, but if the Commission didn't want to vacate the order, it would 
need to change the decision so that the IOUs don't eat any shortfalls.
The Commission can act on the petition to modify whenever it chooses.  In 
addition, it has a continuation meeting scheduled for this Thursday and a 
regularly scheduled business meeting next week.  So the opportunity to act 
and fix the Order is there if the Commission wants to take it.
With respect to the cost of utility generation (i.e., retained generating 
assets and QF contracts), the Commission has a set up a schedule that 
foresses a Commission decision adopting an ""interim"" procurement charge on 
March 27th.  There is another ""workshop"" scheduled for tomorrow to discuss 
the utilities' proposals, after which the utilities will be required to file 
formal ""advice  letters"" with the Commission.  Those advice letters will form 
the basis of the process that the Commission will use to ultimately arrive at 
a decision on the 27th.
Everyone participating in the workshops takes the view that  customers will 
see a separate line item on their bills to cover the going forward costs that 
DWR incurs to buy power.  Everyone participating in the workshops also takes 
the view that customers will be on the hook for DWR's costs and the 
Commission will, if necessary, raise rates to ensure that DWR is made whole.  
(Unfortunately, the Commission is not currently sending signals to show that 
it concurs with the folks participating in the workshops.  And until there is 
clarity on whether the Commission will agree to ""pass through"" those costs, 
Enron and others will continue to have problems with DWR's credit as it 
applies to the RFP that we and others responded to last week.)
Next week begins the hearings to address the issues that Commission started 
to examine began in the emergency hearings held over the holidays, i.e., the 
utilities financial position, TURN's proposal to ""net out"" the utilitities' 
generation-related revenues with the undercollection caused by the rate cap, 
the date on which the rate has (or will) end, etc.    Recently, TURN modified 
its testimony in response to the passage of AB1X.  TURN's new position is 
that the Commission should find that the rate freeze ended on February 1st, 
the effective date of AB1X.   EES will need to quickly determine how and if 
it wants to respond to TURN's latest stance on the end of the rate freeze.
We continue to try to persuade stakeholders and the Commission that DA 
customers must be compensated for the fact that they paid for the utilities' 
stranded generating assets.  That compensation could come in one of two 
forms:  1) access to a proportionate share of the utilities' retained, 
cost-based generating assets, or 2) a credit representing the difference 
between the ""market"" value of the retained generating assets and the book 
value of those assets.  We are not getting much traction thus far.
The Commission is scheduled to issue a separate decision addressing the rate 
freeze issue, the issue of whether to net out generating-related revenues 
against the undercollection, etc. on March 27.  So both sets of issues (the 
procurement charges and the ""end of the rate freeze) are scheduled to be 
""finalized"" on March 27, albeit in separate orders.
With respect to the Block Foward issue, our lawyers had a pretty good meeting 
on Friday with the DWR general counsel and other DWR lawyers.  However, it 
has become clear that despite those efforts, FERC's decision on ""charge 
backs"" will have a significant effect on the resolution of the Block Forward 
issue.

Best,
Jeff

I've left messages describing our idea with TURN and the large

The Commission voted out the order 5-0, essentially as it appeared 
yesterday.  Three key changes:
They clarified that the surcharge applies to Direct Access customers (but the 
entire ""rate freeze"" structure remains intact for now).
The Commission reversed itself and chose not to adopt TURN's ""netting out"" of 
gen revenues and CTC collections, and said instead that the Commission will 
consider it as an option in the next phase (a move likely made in order to 
lower chances of a successful utility appeal).

the utilities and the ratings agencies in reponse to the fact that the 
decision issued by the PUC falls well short of what's needed to keep the IOUs 
credit worthy and solvent.  As a result of those wires stories, the 
utilities' stock has come back (Edison was down as low as 6.25 and is 
currently at 10 7/8; PG&E was at 8 7/8 and is currently at 11 7/8).  We're 
working with Sandi McCubbin, who heads-up our legislative activities in 
California, to get more info and will report back.
The hearing was dominated by highly charged anti-generator, anti-marketer 
rhetoric, which is likely to play a prominent role in the press accounts.  
Only FERC was demonized more.
Each of the Commissioners, including the most recent ""interim"" appointee,  
made strong statements regarding the undesirability of utility bankruptcy.
The Commission left open the possibility of ""doing more"" at their next 
meeting (two weeks from today), which means the negotiations with the 
utilities and ratings agencies are likely to continue. And if an agreement is 
reached, it could end up on the next agenda.

Subject: EMERGENCY CONFERENCE REGARDING CALIFORNIA -- 10/21/2000 -- FINAL 
CALL FOR AGENDA ITEMS INPUT

I have worked closely with Anthony Mazy (Calif Public Utility Comm - Office 
of Ratepayer Advocates) in the past, and he asked me to provide input from 
Enron with our perspective on the energy mess in California for a conference 
they are putting together in October.  (Prior to joining EES I trained the 
CPUC ORA staff on a variety of issues and have earned their trust.)  However, 
I feel that the Enron input into this CPUC conference would be more 
appropriately provided by other members of the EES & ENA team, so I wanted to 
pass this email along to you for your review and action as needed.  

Let me know if my relationship with Anthony and other members of the CPUC 
staff could be useful in advancing Enron's positions at this conference.

CALL FOR AGENDA ITEMS INPUT




CONFERENCE:? "" THE CALIFORNIA DISASTER: LESSONS LEARNED "" 
??????????????????????????????????????????????????? (Working Title) 

DATE:????????????????????????????????? Saturday,? October 21, 2000 

LOCATION:?????????????????????? University of California, Berkeley 

The CPUC Office of Ratepayer Advocates (ORA) together with the University of 
California is organizing a special conference, Saturday October 21, 2000, to 
address the current wholesale electricity market situation, as manifest in 
San Diego, and in light of both the economic framework and industrial 
realities in which utility restructuring is taking place.

We wish to emphasize the importance of maintaining consistent and predictable 
forward progress with the restructuring of the electric services industry, 
while remediating structural shortcomings as they appear.? The need for a 
quick and effective response to the cost escalation in California is urgent.? 
Meanwhile, we do not want to overlook emerging generation and information 
technologies and their appropriate role in an increasingly competitive energy 
and utility sector.

Your input is urgently requested to develop the detailed agenda for this 
workshop/conference.? We have had the opportunity to speak with some of you 
directly, and we appreciate your comments.? We are presently concluding 
negotiations with key national observers to be participants, and must 
complete the detailed agenda this week.? If you have any further topical 
insights to share with us, I must have your input no later than 4:00 p.m. 
Pacific time, Thursday, September 14.? (By 4:00 p.m., Wednesday, if at all 
possible.)

Let me emphasize that today we are only concerned with conceptual, topical 
content, so please do not trouble yourselves with highly ""stylized"" 
presentations.?? Our immediate objective is to release a preliminary program, 
with a partial list of key participants, by Monday, September 18th, that we 
believe is likely to secure the active support of a wide range of industry 
stakeholders.? We plan to distribute a final program by Monday, September 
25th.

Please suggest topical areas that you can help develop, or believe are 
essential to the success of this program.? We will be particularly interested 
in your informed, practical insights into:

the daily operations of the electric services industry, from various 
perspectives, that help clarify problems and distinguish truly problematic 
issues from those misunderstood,

the political and legislative processes in California, as they may tend to 
suggest effective courses of action to promote short-term market 
accommodations that are consistent with, and constructive toward, long-term 
goals for industry restructuring,

case studies from other jurisdictions that shed light on the probable 
response of California's institutions to any of the various proposed 
solutions currently circulating,

case studies of anachronistic or otherwise inefficient industry practices 
impeding development, interconnection, or operation of distributed 
generation, or the sale or other transfer of the energy produced,

case studies of market power abuse, or gaming, in both transmission and 
generation, 

proposals for innovative treatment of cost-effective emerging generation 
and/or information technologies, 

proposals for developing greater diversity of generation technologies and/or 
energy providers within the state, 

otherwise appropriate technical, economic, or regulatory principles and 
practices that are being misrepresented in the academic, trade, or popular 
press or other media, 

distinguishing informational difficulties or factual disagreements from 
policy conflicts or conflicts of interest, and 

specific suggestions for speakers who are particularly effective in 
addressing specific key issues or establishing confidence with the target 
audiences.

Attendance at this conference/workshop will be limited, with approximately 
one-half of the seats reserved for key policymakers and/or their aides, key 
agency staff, and the speakers.? The remaining seats will be allocated among 
interested consumer representatives, manufacturers, vendors, developers, and 
other end-users, and local government and community and business 
representatives.? We presently envision the conference to include one or two 
key speakers, with four panels of three to seven persons each addressing 
specific topics.? We are also reserving facilities for Friday evening to 
address topical seminars requested by decisionmakers and/or their key staff 
and additional facilities for Sunday morning when the information technology 
and distributed generation communities will be invited to provide additional 
follow-on to questions and comments offered by key policymakers on Saturday.

Some have commented that we should have started this as much as a year ago.? 
Unfortunately, a year ago we did not know that today we would have doubled 
and tripled consumer energy bills or a $250/MWH wholesale price cap, much 
less an intense, across-the-board attack on electric restructuring by some 
parties.? We are especially concerned about the efforts of some distribution 
utilities to establish a foothold in DG, the efforts of some utilities and 
the independent system operator to restrict distribution-level wheeling and 
the aggregation it would facilitate, and the latest proposal to reintegrate 
metering into the distribution utility after it was successfully unbundled 
for the benefit of competitive Energy Service Providers.? Likewise, language 
in recent legislation echoing regulatory arguments for retrenchment cannot be 
brushed aside.? 

We understand the difficulty of organizing such an event on less than two 
months notice, but we also appreciate the importance of the subject, as we 
are sure you do as well.? We are committed to preparing an event worthy of 
the time and attention of both key national observers and top-ranked 
California policymakers in the executive, legislative, and regulatory arenas, 
and we would welcome your active assistance.? 

If you have any questions, you are welcomed to call me, at 415-703-3036 from 
9:30 AM to 5:30 PM Pacific time.? For those with particularly busy schedules 
or time zone considerations, you are welcomed to call me at my personal 
telephone 925-855-0554 from 5:30 to 7:30 AM Pacific time.

The Commission voted out the order 5-0, essentially as it appeared 
yesterday.  Three key changes:
They clarified that the surcharge applies to Direct Access customers (but the 
entire ""rate freeze"" structure remains intact for now).
The Commission reversed itself and chose not to adopt TURN's ""netting out"" of

The Commission added to the decision language saying that it will study the

On this last point, wire reports are rampant about the possibility that 
legislation will be introduced as early as today proposing to securitize the 
utilties' power purchase costs.  This action has reportedly been the result 
of discussions that occured through the night between the governor's office, 
the utilities and the ratings agencies in reponse to the fact that the 
decision issued by the PUC falls well short of what's needed to keep the IOUs 
credit worthy and solvent.  As a result of those wires stories, the 
utilities' stock has come back (Edison was down as low as 6.25 and is 
currently at 10 7/8; PG&E was at 8 7/8 and is currently at 11 7/8).  We're 
working with Sandi McCubbin, who heads-up our legislative activities in 
California, to get more info and will report back.
The hearing was dominated by highly charged anti-generator, anti-marketer 
rhetoric, which is likely to play a prominent role in the press accounts.  
Only FERC was demonized more.
Each of the Commissioners, including the most recent ""interim"" appointee,  
made strong statements regarding the undesirability of utility bankruptcy.
The Commission left open the possibility of ""doing more"" at their next 
meeting (two weeks from today), which means the negotiations with the 
utilities and ratings agencies are likely to continue. And if an agreement is 
reached, it could end up on the next agenda.

Subject: PUC Approves DWR Language in Decision; Removes Language Staying 
Commission Action on Direct Access

The Commission just voted out one half of the ""Bilas Alternate.""

The decision that got voted out included Bilas' DWR-based language stating 
that the PUC 1) would not second-guess DWR purchases and 2) would pass 
through DWR costs to customers.
However, in a move led by Commissioner Carl Wood, the decision removed the 
Bilas language on Direct Access.  The decision therefore did NOT include the 
Bilas language staying any Commission action on implementing the Direct 
Access prohibition.  Carl Wood called including Direct Access ""the height of 
arrogance.""  
The decision was voted out 3-2, with the 2 remaining Republicans dissenting.
That said, the Commission has no proposal before it implementing the 
prohibition, and there was no talk at the meeting of implementing the 
prohibition any time soon.

Best,
Jeff

Subject: More Info: PG&E to Announce Open Season on Redwood and Baja Early 
Next Week

PG&E will announce via press release very early next week an open season on 
Redwood, Baja and Silverado.
It comes in direct response to recent announcements of expansions into 
California by pipelines.
The bid protocols will be structured similar to original open season from the 
original Gas Accord.
The open season will start on June 1 and end on July 31.
Capacity will be available starting 1.1.03.
Bidders will be able to bid up to 30 years (PG&E states that that's what 
generators want).
Accompanying the announcement will be another announcement that PG&E will 
expand Redwood by 200mmcf/day, which they hope to have available by 1.1.03, 
or some time during Q103.
About 2-4 weeks after the open season begins, PG&E will file its proposed 
""Gas Accord II,""  (the first one expires end of 02).
As part of that filing, PG&E will offer its proposed ratemaking treatment for 
the next five years (beginning 1.1.03).
PG&E will not include in the open season 1) core capacity and 2) certain EAD 
contracts that extend beyond the Gas Accord 1 end date.
In addition, PG&E will hold back an additional 20% (after excluding core and 
EAD), to be ""open-seasoned"" at some ""future"" date.
The capacity to be auctioned is: 1) 900 mmcf/day on Redwood, 2) 245 (annual) 
on Baja, plus an additional 200/day in summer on Baja, 3) 155 on Silverado.
How PG&E will market the 20% they intend to hold back, and when they might 
auction it off in the future will be discussed in PG&E's Gas Accord II filing.
No single company will be awarded more than 30% of the capacity on any 
specific path in the primary open season (though firms can bid whatever level 
of capacity they choose).

Please forwad along to anyone else who might be interested.  If you have any 
questions, just holler.

Best,
Jeff

phenomenal.  Don't look back.  And PR, under the circumstances, is doing a

Subject: ISO-NE failure to mitigate ICAP market -- Release of ISO NE 
confidential information



The New England Conference of Public Utilities Commissioners (NECUPUC) filed 
an Answer if Support of the Motion of the Maine Public Utilities Commission 
for Disclosure of Information.
NECUPUC supports the request for the release of the unredacted copies of 
ISO-NE's September 21, 2000 Answer in this case.  In the alternative, they 
would ask that the Commission provide to the regulators that are parties to 
the proceeding unredacted copies of the ISO's September 21, 2000 Answer 
subject to an appropriate protective order.



Duke Energy North America (DENA) filed an Answer that opposes the MPUC 
request for public information.

DENA argues that only a  three month lag in the release of confidential 
information is impermissible under a prior FERC ruling in the NSTAR Services 
Co. case which set out a six-month lag rule for the release of information.
Their second argument was that the request seeks information for all NEPOOL 
markets and not just the ICAP market which is subject to the suit.
If the FERC authorizes the release of confidential information, then it 
should be subject to a protective order which contains the following:
The information may only be used for the purposes of this docket.
Only specifically named ""reviewing Reps associated with the MPUC may review 
the information.
The confidential materials may not be removed from the NE-ISO's premises.
The reviewing rep must execute a nondisclosure certificate.


Answer to the MPUC's Motion for Disclosure of Information from Northeast 
Utilities Service Company and Select Energy and request for expedited 
commission action.  NUSCO and Select Energy Support MPUC's request for 
disclosure of information that the ISO has filed under seal, but opposes the 
selective disclosure of this information to the MPUC and other regulatory 
commissions and not other participants.   NUSCO and Select Energy request 
expedited action due the financial implications and there is also 
considerable uncertainty regarding prices in the residual ICAP market in 
January, February and March of 2000 due to the suspended settlement pending 
Commission guidance.

NECUPUC supports the request for the release of the unredacted copies of 
ISO-NE's September 21, 2000 Answer in this case.  In the alternative, they 
would ask that the Commission provide to the regulators that are parties to 
the proceeding unredacted copies of the ISO's September 21, 2000 Answer 
subject to an appropriate protective order.



Duke Energy North America (DENA) filed an Answer that opposes the MPUC 
request for public information.

DENA argues that only a  three month lag in the release of confidential 
information is impermissible under a prior FERC ruling in the NSTAR Services 
Co. case which set out a six-month lag rule for the release of information.
Their second argument was that the request seeks information for all NEPOOL 
markets and not just the ICAP market which is subject to the suit.
If the FERC authorizes the release of confidential information, then it 
should be subject to a protective order which contains the following:
The information may only be used for the purposes of this docket.
Only specifically named ""reviewing Reps associated with the MPUC may review 
the information.
The confidential materials may not be removed from the NE-ISO's premises.
The reviewing rep must execute a nondisclosure certificate.


Answer to the MPUC's Motion for Disclosure of Information from Northeast 
Utilities Service Company and Select Energy and request for expedited 
commission action.  NUSCO and Select Energy Support MPUC's request for 
disclosure of information that the ISO has filed under seal, but opposes the 
selective disclosure of this information to the MPUC and other regulatory 
commissions and not other participants.   NUSCO and Select Energy request 
expedited action due the financial implications and there is also 
considerable uncertainty regarding prices in the residual ICAP market in 
January, February and March of 2000 due to the suspended settlement pending 
Commission guidance.

Subject: Re: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to 
Assignment)

Changing counterparty names on Sitara deal tickets has absolutely no impact 
to any downstream processes.  

I hope the following will give more clarification.   

Let me know if you have any questions or need more detail! 

Thanks,
dg  3-9517


Sitara / Unify - Process
* Scenario - Counterparty name changes on Sitara deal ticket after deal had 
been pathed, scheduled & bridged back from Unify.
* Impact - zero impact to Logistics & Volume Management, absolutely 
harmless.  Settlements has process in place to eliminate issues.
* Process - 
Counterparty A in Sitara changes to Counterparty B.   
Ctprty A was on original path sent to pipeline.  
The new name (ctprty B) does bridge over to Unify.
Ctprty A remains at the path level in Unify (gui display does not change)
Ctprty B is now displayed at the deal level in Unify.  The field is now 
highlighted to indicate a change occurred. (gui display changes only at high 
level, not on path)
The Scheduler has choice to repath (if necessary), or not re-path
If re-pathing occurs, the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path

Unify pushes back the deal number & meter to Sitara (not ctprty info)
Balancing works on deal number & meter only (not ctprty info)
The confirmation desk utilizes the information in Sitara (where all 
information is correct)
Volume Management utilizes the information in Unify for pipeline tie-out.  
(all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match 
up perfectly)
Settlements utilizes information in Unify.  
Settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts, which 
would create two notification entries
If invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty, re-draft would occur.
(note:  there was an issues discovered on reports which IT is correcting now)


Autonoms ""Tom's words of warning"" - 
Previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after 
deals were pathed and nominated.  Basically it would change a key on an EDI 
path (duns number) not affecting any other of the information already 
nominated to the pipeline.  If the scheduler re-nominated, data at the 
pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have NO way to correct 
the problem.  In most cases, the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to 
manually cut the original nominated volume.  This is not an issue with Unify 
(as explained above).


(Dave - feel free to chime in if I left anything out.)

Changing counterparty names on Sitara deal tickets has absolutely no impact 
to any downstream processes.  

I hope the following will give more clarification.   

Let me know if you have any questions or need more detail! 

Thanks,
dg  3-9517


Sitara / Unify - Process
* Scenario - Counterparty name changes on Sitara deal ticket after deal had 
been pathed, scheduled & bridged back from Unify.
* Impact - zero impact to Logistics & Volume Management, absolutely 
harmless.  Settlements has process in place to eliminate issues.
* Process - 
Counterparty A in Sitara changes to Counterparty B.   
Ctprty A was on original path sent to pipeline.  
The new name (ctprty B) does bridge over to Unify.
Ctprty A remains at the path level in Unify (gui display does not change)
Ctprty B is now displayed at the deal level in Unify.  The field is now 
highlighted to indicate a change occurred. (gui display changes only at high 
level, not on path)
The Scheduler has choice to repath (if necessary), or not re-path
If re-pathing occurs, the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path

Unify pushes back the deal number & meter to Sitara (not ctprty info)
Balancing works on deal number & meter only (not ctprty info)
The confirmation desk utilizes the information in Sitara (where all 
information is correct)
Volume Management utilizes the information in Unify for pipeline tie-out.  
(all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match 
up perfectly)
Settlements utilizes information in Unify.  
Settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts, which 
would create two notification entries
If invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty, re-draft would occur.
(note:  there was an issues discovered on reports which IT is correcting now)


Autonoms ""Tom's words of warning"" - 
Previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after 
deals were pathed and nominated.  Basically it would change a key on an EDI 
path (duns number) not affecting any other of the information already 
nominated to the pipeline.  If the scheduler re-nominated, data at the 
pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have NO way to correct 
the problem.  In most cases, the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to 
manually cut the original nominated volume.  This is not an issue with Unify 
(as explained above).

Subject: Re: Sitara Release (Re: Changes in Global due to Consent to 
Assignment)

Changing counterparty names on Sitara deal tickets has absolutely no impact 
to any downstream processes.  

I hope the following will give more clarification.   

Let me know if you have any questions or need more detail! 

Thanks,
dg  3-9517


Sitara / Unify - Process
* Scenario - Counterparty name changes on Sitara deal ticket after deal had 
been pathed, scheduled & bridged back from Unify.
* Impact - zero impact to Logistics & Volume Management, absolutely 
harmless.  Settlements has process in place to eliminate issues.
* Process - 
Counterparty A in Sitara changes to Counterparty B.   
Ctprty A was on original path sent to pipeline.  
The new name (ctprty B) does bridge over to Unify.
Ctprty A remains at the path level in Unify (gui display does not change)
Ctprty B is now displayed at the deal level in Unify.  The field is now 
highlighted to indicate a change occurred. (gui display changes only at high 
level, not on path)
The Scheduler has choice to repath (if necessary), or not re-path
If re-pathing occurs, the new counterparty name will be displaced on new path

Unify pushes back the deal number & meter to Sitara (not ctprty info)
Balancing works on deal number & meter only (not ctprty info)
The confirmation desk utilizes the information in Sitara (where all 
information is correct)
Volume Management utilizes the information in Unify for pipeline tie-out.  
(all information sent to pipeline is correct at the path level and will match 
up perfectly)
Settlements utilizes information in Unify.  
Settlements recognizes that changed ctprty names changes contracts, which 
would create two notification entries
If invoice did happen to go out to wrong ctprty, re-draft would occur.
(note:  there was an issues discovered on reports which IT is correcting now)


Autonoms ""Tom's words of warning"" - 
Previously there was an issue when counterparty name changes took place after 
deals were pathed and nominated.  Basically it would change a key on an EDI 
path (duns number) not affecting any other of the information already 
nominated to the pipeline.  If the scheduler re-nominated, data at the 
pipeline would get doubled up and the scheduler would have NO way to correct 
the problem.  In most cases, the schedulers would have to get the pipeline to 
manually cut the original nominated volume.  This is not an issue with Unify 
(as explained above).

Mike and Andy,

Andy, I tried to send this message to Richard as well, but the computer 
directory is fouled up and won't let me do it.  I hope sending it to you is 
sufficient, but if not, let me know.

I received a call from Mike Noone of Mike Beatty & Associates about the 
above-referenced lawsuit, which is filed in state court in Garfield County, 
Colorado.  For Andy's reference, Beatty & Associates is representing the 
Enron entities and a number of other defendants in the Grynberg MDL case.  
This case is not a gas measurement case, which is the gist of the Grynberg 
action.

Noone's firm represents the plaintiff; I did not ask who represents the 
defendants, all of whom are Questar entities.  The lawsuit arises out of a 
partnerhip agreement to build the Transcolorado Pipeline.  The Transcolorado 
Pipeline takes gas from Colorado producers at its northern end to an 
interconnect (or interconnects) at its southern end to either El Paso or TW, 
who deliver the gas to California markets.  After it was built, Questar 
allegedly began building a competing pipeline, called the Main Line 104 
Project (the designation used in the FERC filings), which will connect 
Questar's gathering system at the northern end of the pipeline to the Kern 
River Pipeline.  Kern River will apparently ultimately deliver the gas to 
California markets.  KN contends that the Main Line 104 Project will take gas 
from exactly the same basins as the Transcolorado Pipeline (the Picence and 
Ulenta Basins, if I have that spelled correctly) and is in direct 
competition.  I did not ask Mike what relief KN is requesting.

KN is interested in documentation from TW and ENA that discusses what their 
competitive options are in getting gas from the area served by the 
Transcolorado Pipeline to California markets.  It appears that KN is hoping 
to see some discussion of the Main Line 104 Project as an alternative to the 
Transcolorado Pipeline.  It strikes me that such information may be highly 
sensitive.

I asked Mike why he thought ENA would have any such information, and Mike 
said that he thought ENA might own or have an interest in some producing 
properties in the relevant area.  I told Mike that that would be a surprise 
to me, and that EOG, which is the Enron entity that typically owns such 
interests, was spun off last year.  Mike said he would take another look to 
see why they thought ENA would have such information.

The trial date is one year out, and this is apparently the first round of 
discovery.  Mike would not be surprised if we got a call from Questar's 
attorneys, requesting the same information.

Noone faxed to me the proposed subpoenas, with the understanding that I was 
not authorized to accept service for them.  I will send copies to each of 
you.  Let me know if you would like the Unit to handle or assist in the 
handling of this.

Subject: Complaint Against Gas Sellers to Reimpose Price Caps - Docket No 
RP01-223

The National Association of Gas Consumers (an association of municipal gas 
systems) has filed a complaint against all sellers of natural gas in the US 
to re-impose wholesale prices caps.  They are seeking a benchmark (soft cap) 
of $2.74/MMBtu.

The benchmark figure is based on an average gas forecast from a recent 
National Petroleum Council study.  (Ken Lay is a member of the NPC).

The procedural rules are a bit fuzzy.  Ordinarily, respondents have 20 days 
to answer a complaint.   However, FERC rules provide for service on 
respondents.  Here NAGC has not named specific respondents.

Drew, 

This was in today's WSJ, but I don't see anything prior to that that isn't a

the Blockbuster deal.  Let me know if this is it!

Lorna  
-----------------------------------------------------
09/20/2000  
The Wall Street Journal  
 
Texas Journal  
T2  
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)  
  
 
  
Blockbuster hasn't enjoyed a great market reception. 

In fact, it has fared so poorly since going public 13 months ago that today 
you can pick up a share of the Dallas video-rental giant for the price of a 
video rental and a couple of late fees. 
 
  
But analysts who have promoted the stock from its initial public offering in 
August 1999 say now is a better time than ever to bet on Blockbuster. They 
say the company is poised to capitalize both on its ubiquitous stores and the 
emerging market for delivering movies over the Internet. 
""There are a lot of factors that make it incredibly attractive,"" says Patrick 
J. O'Hare, an analyst in Chicago with briefing.com, an online market-analysis 
firm. 

For starters, Blockbuster, with 5,000 blue-and-yellow stores in the U.S. 
alone, is the leading video retailer and one of the country's best-known 
brand names. Its stock, which closed yesterday at $9.188, looks inexpensive. 
Blockbuster is also moving beyond its storefronts. In July, Blockbuster 
signed a 20-year agreement to sell movies over the growing broadband network 
being built by Houston-based Enron. 

There's more. Mr. O'Hare notes that the company's earnings are expected to 
grow at a 20% annual clip over the next five years, while the stock trades at 
a relatively inexpensive 14 times earnings. In 2001, the company's earnings 
are projected to grow by 28%. So by one measure, Blockbuster trades for about 
half that rate. The stock also trades for less than one third of its book 
value. 

Of course, the stock price has been depressed for a long time, ever since 
majority owner Viacom sold 18% of Blockbuster in an IPO. (New York-based 
Viacom plans to distribute the rest to its shareholders, but is waiting for 
the price to rise.) Blockbuster ended its first day of trading at $15, its 
offering price. It went down from there and bottomed out at $8.88 on June 27. 

Not even a better-than-expected second-quarter financial report on Aug. 2 
helped much. The company lost 16 cents a share, compared with a 28-cent net 
loss a year earlier. Excluding losses from new-media initiatives, such as 
development of its Blockbuster.com Web site, it posted cash earnings of $24.1 
million, or 14 cents a share, which beat analysts' expectations. 

Analysts say the news will improve, with a consensus estimate that 
Blockbuster will earn 64 cents a share before charges this year. The company 
also expects its market share to reach at least 35% this year, four times 
that of its nearest competitor, Hollywood Entertainment's Hollywood Video. 

It adds up to rosy projections. Briefing.com's Mr. O'Hare says the stock 
could double in the next 12 to 18 months. Salomon Smith Barney analyst David 
Riedel in New York has a $26 target price, also in 12 to 18 months. (Mr. 
Riedel's firm was an underwriter for Blockbuster's IPO.) 

So why has the stock languished? One culprit is the new-media initiatives, 
which are obscuring the company's profits elsewhere. And, as Blockbuster 
Chief Executive John Antioco noted recently when warning that third-quarter 
revenue would be slow, there have been few recent big hits among the new 
video releases. 

Mr. Antioco also acknowledges there may be confusion over how well 
Blockbuster is mixing its traditional retail business with the advent of 
movies-on-demand and other new-media ventures. Indeed, for all Blockbuster's 
talk about new media, it doesn't yet deliver movies electronically and 
customers still can't do things like reserve movies by using Blockbuster.com. 
Thus far, customers can do little more than buy videos and digital videodisks 
on the Web site. 

""Perhaps the story may be more complicated than some people have time for,"" 
Mr. Antioco says. ""People who buy retail stocks don't fully understand our 
story, and people who buy media stocks may not totally understand the 
transition."" In the end, the company will be a mix of new media and 
traditional retailing. But until that picture becomes clearer, the result, 
Mr. Antioco says, ""is the stock malaise."" 

But Mr. Antioco says Blockbuster is now in an ideal position. The company has 
delivered solid earnings from its core video-store business and has struck 
potentially big deals to bring movies to consumers in their homes. 
""Blockbuster, as a pure retail play, has done what it said it's going to do,"" 
Mr. Antioco says. ""Now we have several [new-media] plays beyond that."" 

Indeed, just this year Blockbuster has entered into five deals to supplement 
its in-store rentals through showings of movies on outlets such as DirecTV, a 
unit of Hughes Electronics, El Segundo, Calif. 

The agreement with the most potential, analysts say, is the Enron deal, in 
which Blockbuster will distribute movies over the energy giant's broadband 
network to set-top boxes in consumers' homes. Mr. Antioco says Blockbuster 
will be delivering movies in a couple of markets served by Enron's network by 
the end of the year and predicts that will be just a prelude to a wider 
rollout in 2001. 

Certainly, there are potential stumbling blocks. To make the deal work, Enron 
and Blockbuster need digital-subscriber-line providers to step up enrollment 
and solve the spotty service and technical glitches that have plagued large 
numbers of users. 

""The issue for Blockbuster is going to be availability,"" says Mike Goodman, a 
senior analyst with Yankee Group, a market-research firm in Boston. Yankee 
projects there will be 1.45 million DSL users by the end of this year, 
increasing to about 8.4 million in 2004. 

That's a substantial number of subscribers, but it's also just a potential 
customer base for Blockbuster. Mr. Antioco says the digital future is a ways 
off -- it may be 10 years before revenue from electronic delivery of movies 
catches up with video-store revenue. 

Even the beginning of the DSL-dependent rollout will take up to a couple of 
years, according to Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass. It says movies 
won't be delivered to more than a few markets until sometime in 2002 -- not 
2001, as Blockbuster predicts. But Mr. Antioco says agreements with the 
regional phone companies that provide DSL will bear fruit sooner and that the 
company will soon announce other partners such as a maker of the set-top 
boxes needed to order movies. 

Briefing.com's Mr. O'Hare argues that now is the time to buy because 
Blockbuster's stock could move fast once investors grasp the possibilities of 
the company's plan for multimedia distribution. 

Both Mr. O'Hare and Salomon Smith Barney's Mr. Riedel classify Blockbuster as 
particularly risky but say the company's outside-the-store initiatives should 
serve as a catalyst for the stock over the next 18 or so months. 

Mr. O'Hare says that time frame may not be compatible with investors' ""notion 
of instant gratification."" But, he says, ""it's worth it 
in this case.""

al/Third-party subpoenas

Mike and Andy,

Andy, I tried to send this message to Richard as well, but the computer 
directory is fouled up and won't let me do it.  I hope sending it to you is 
sufficient, but if not, let me know.

I received a call from Mike Noone of Mike Beatty & Associates about the 
above-referenced lawsuit, which is filed in state court in Garfield County, 
Colorado.  For Andy's reference, Beatty & Associates is representing the 
Enron entities and a number of other defendants in the Grynberg MDL case.  
This case is not a gas measurement case, which is the gist of the Grynberg 
action.

Noone's firm represents the plaintiff; I did not ask who represents the 
defendants, all of whom are Questar entities.  The lawsuit arises out of a 
partnerhip agreement to build the Transcolorado Pipeline.  The Transcolorado 
Pipeline takes gas from Colorado producers at its northern end to an 
interconnect (or interconnects) at its southern end to either El Paso or TW, 
who deliver the gas to California markets.  After it was built, Questar 
allegedly began building a competing pipeline, called the Main Line 104 
Project (the designation used in the FERC filings), which will connect 
Questar's gathering system at the northern end of the pipeline to the Kern 
River Pipeline.  Kern River will apparently ultimately deliver the gas to 
California markets.  KN contends that the Main Line 104 Project will take gas 
from exactly the same basins as the Transcolorado Pipeline (the Picence and 
Ulenta Basins, if I have that spelled correctly) and is in direct 
competition.  I did not ask Mike what relief KN is requesting.

KN is interested in documentation from TW and ENA that discusses what their 
competitive options are in getting gas from the area served by the 
Transcolorado Pipeline to California markets.  It appears that KN is hoping 
to see some discussion of the Main Line 104 Project as an alternative to the 
Transcolorado Pipeline.  It strikes me that such information may be highly 
sensitive.

I asked Mike why he thought ENA would have any such information, and Mike 
said that he thought ENA might own or have an interest in some producing 
properties in the relevant area.  I told Mike that that would be a surprise 
to me, and that EOG, which is the Enron entity that typically owns such 
interests, was spun off last year.  Mike said he would take another look to 
see why they thought ENA would have such information.

The trial date is one year out, and this is apparently the first round of 
discovery.  Mike would not be surprised if we got a call from Questar's 
attorneys, requesting the same information.

Noone faxed to me the proposed subpoenas, with the understanding that I was 
not authorized to accept service for them.  I will send copies to each of 
you.  Let me know if you would like the Unit to handle or assist in the 
handling of this.

Subject: Complaint Against Gas Sellers to Reimpose Price Caps - Docket No 
RP01-223

The National Association of Gas Consumers (an association of municipal gas 
systems) has filed a complaint against all sellers of natural gas in the US 
to re-impose wholesale prices caps.  They are seeking a benchmark (soft cap) 
of $2.74/MMBtu.

The benchmark figure is based on an average gas forecast from a recent 
National Petroleum Council study.  (Ken Lay is a member of the NPC).

The procedural rules are a bit fuzzy.  Ordinarily, respondents have 20 days 
to answer a complaint.   However, FERC rules provide for service on 
respondents.  Here NAGC has not named specific respondents.

Drew, 

This was in today's WSJ, but I don't see anything prior to that that isn't a

Blockbuster hasn't enjoyed a great market reception. 

In fact, it has fared so poorly since going public 13 months ago that today 
you can pick up a share of the Dallas video-rental giant for the price of a 
video rental and a couple of late fees. 
 
  
But analysts who have promoted the stock from its initial public offering in 
August 1999 say now is a better time than ever to bet on Blockbuster. They 
say the company is poised to capitalize both on its ubiquitous stores and the 
emerging market for delivering movies over the Internet. 
""There are a lot of factors that make it incredibly attractive,"" says Patrick 
J. O'Hare, an analyst in Chicago with briefing.com, an online market-analysis 
firm. 

For starters, Blockbuster, with 5,000 blue-and-yellow stores in the U.S. 
alone, is the leading video retailer and one of the country's best-known 
brand names. Its stock, which closed yesterday at $9.188, looks inexpensive. 
Blockbuster is also moving beyond its storefronts. In July, Blockbuster 
signed a 20-year agreement to sell movies over the growing broadband network 
being built by Houston-based Enron. 

There's more. Mr. O'Hare notes that the company's earnings are expected to 
grow at a 20% annual clip over the next five years, while the stock trades at 
a relatively inexpensive 14 times earnings. In 2001, the company's earnings 
are projected to grow by 28%. So by one measure, Blockbuster trades for about 
half that rate. The stock also trades for less than one third of its book 
value. 

Of course, the stock price has been depressed for a long time, ever since 
majority owner Viacom sold 18% of Blockbuster in an IPO. (New York-based 
Viacom plans to distribute the rest to its shareholders, but is waiting for 
the price to rise.) Blockbuster ended its first day of trading at $15, its 
offering price. It went down from there and bottomed out at $8.88 on June 27. 

Not even a better-than-expected second-quarter financial report on Aug. 2 
helped much. The company lost 16 cents a share, compared with a 28-cent net 
loss a year earlier. Excluding losses from new-media initiatives, such as 
development of its Blockbuster.com Web site, it posted cash earnings of $24.1 
million, or 14 cents a share, which beat analysts' expectations. 

Analysts say the news will improve, with a consensus estimate that 
Blockbuster will earn 64 cents a share before charges this year. The company 
also expects its market share to reach at least 35% this year, four times 
that of its nearest competitor, Hollywood Entertainment's Hollywood Video. 

It adds up to rosy projections. Briefing.com's Mr. O'Hare says the stock 
could double in the next 12 to 18 months. Salomon Smith Barney analyst David 
Riedel in New York has a $26 target price, also in 12 to 18 months. (Mr. 
Riedel's firm was an underwriter for Blockbuster's IPO.) 

So why has the stock languished? One culprit is the new-media initiatives, 
which are obscuring the company's profits elsewhere. And, as Blockbuster 
Chief Executive John Antioco noted recently when warning that third-quarter 
revenue would be slow, there have been few recent big hits among the new 
video releases. 

Mr. Antioco also acknowledges there may be confusion over how well 
Blockbuster is mixing its traditional retail business with the advent of 
movies-on-demand and other new-media ventures. Indeed, for all Blockbuster's 
talk about new media, it doesn't yet deliver movies electronically and 
customers still can't do things like reserve movies by using Blockbuster.com. 
Thus far, customers can do little more than buy videos and digital videodisks 
on the Web site. 

""Perhaps the story may be more complicated than some people have time for,"" 
Mr. Antioco says. ""People who buy retail stocks don't fully understand our 
story, and people who buy media stocks may not totally understand the 
transition."" In the end, the company will be a mix of new media and 
traditional retailing. But until that picture becomes clearer, the result, 
Mr. Antioco says, ""is the stock malaise."" 

But Mr. Antioco says Blockbuster is now in an ideal position. The company has 
delivered solid earnings from its core video-store business and has struck 
potentially big deals to bring movies to consumers in their homes. 
""Blockbuster, as a pure retail play, has done what it said it's going to do,"" 
Mr. Antioco says. ""Now we have several [new-media] plays beyond that."" 

Indeed, just this year Blockbuster has entered into five deals to supplement 
its in-store rentals through showings of movies on outlets such as DirecTV, a 
unit of Hughes Electronics, El Segundo, Calif. 

The agreement with the most potential, analysts say, is the Enron deal, in 
which Blockbuster will distribute movies over the energy giant's broadband 
network to set-top boxes in consumers' homes. Mr. Antioco says Blockbuster 
will be delivering movies in a couple of markets served by Enron's network by 
the end of the year and predicts that will be just a prelude to a wider 
rollout in 2001. 

Certainly, there are potential stumbling blocks. To make the deal work, Enron 
and Blockbuster need digital-subscriber-line providers to step up enrollment 
and solve the spotty service and technical glitches that have plagued large 
numbers of users. 

""The issue for Blockbuster is going to be availability,"" says Mike Goodman, a 
senior analyst with Yankee Group, a market-research firm in Boston. Yankee 
projects there will be 1.45 million DSL users by the end of this year, 
increasing to about 8.4 million in 2004. 

That's a substantial number of subscribers, but it's also just a potential 
customer base for Blockbuster. Mr. Antioco says the digital future is a ways 
off -- it may be 10 years before revenue from electronic delivery of movies 
catches up with video-store revenue. 

Even the beginning of the DSL-dependent rollout will take up to a couple of 
years, according to Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass. It says movies 
won't be delivered to more than a few markets until sometime in 2002 -- not 
2001, as Blockbuster predicts. But Mr. Antioco says agreements with the 
regional phone companies that provide DSL will bear fruit sooner and that the 
company will soon announce other partners such as a maker of the set-top 
boxes needed to order movies. 

Briefing.com's Mr. O'Hare argues that now is the time to buy because 
Blockbuster's stock could move fast once investors grasp the possibilities of 
the company's plan for multimedia distribution. 

Both Mr. O'Hare and Salomon Smith Barney's Mr. Riedel classify Blockbuster as 
particularly risky but say the company's outside-the-store initiatives should 
serve as a catalyst for the stock over the next 18 or so months. 

Mr. O'Hare says that time frame may not be compatible with investors' ""notion 
of instant gratification."" But, he says, ""it's worth it 
in this case.""

Subject: Complaint Against Gas Sellers to Reimpose Price Caps - Docket No 
RP01-223

The National Association of Gas Consumers (an association of municipal gas 
systems) has filed a complaint against all sellers of natural gas in the US 
to re-impose wholesale prices caps.  They are seeking a benchmark (soft cap) 
of $2.74/MMBtu.

The benchmark figure is based on an average gas forecast from a recent 
National Petroleum Council study.  (Ken Lay is a member of the NPC).

The procedural rules are a bit fuzzy.  Ordinarily, respondents have 20 days 
to answer a complaint.   However, FERC rules provide for service on 
respondents.  Here NAGC has not named specific respondents.

al/Third-party subpoenas

Mike and Andy,

Andy, I tried to send this message to Richard as well, but the computer 
directory is fouled up and won't let me do it.  I hope sending it to you is 
sufficient, but if not, let me know.

I received a call from Mike Noone of Mike Beatty & Associates about the 
above-referenced lawsuit, which is filed in state court in Garfield County, 
Colorado.  For Andy's reference, Beatty & Associates is representing the 
Enron entities and a number of other defendants in the Grynberg MDL case.  
This case is not a gas measurement case, which is the gist of the Grynberg 
action.

Noone's firm represents the plaintiff; I did not ask who represents the 
defendants, all of whom are Questar entities.  The lawsuit arises out of a 
partnerhip agreement to build the Transcolorado Pipeline.  The Transcolorado 
Pipeline takes gas from Colorado producers at its northern end to an 
interconnect (or interconnects) at its southern end to either El Paso or TW, 
who deliver the gas to California markets.  After it was built, Questar 
allegedly began building a competing pipeline, called the Main Line 104 
Project (the designation used in the FERC filings), which will connect 
Questar's gathering system at the northern end of the pipeline to the Kern 
River Pipeline.  Kern River will apparently ultimately deliver the gas to 
California markets.  KN contends that the Main Line 104 Project will take gas 
from exactly the same basins as the Transcolorado Pipeline (the Picence and 
Ulenta Basins, if I have that spelled correctly) and is in direct 
competition.  I did not ask Mike what relief KN is requesting.

KN is interested in documentation from TW and ENA that discusses what their 
competitive options are in getting gas from the area served by the 
Transcolorado Pipeline to California markets.  It appears that KN is hoping 
to see some discussion of the Main Line 104 Project as an alternative to the 
Transcolorado Pipeline.  It strikes me that such information may be highly 
sensitive.

I asked Mike why he thought ENA would have any such information, and Mike 
said that he thought ENA might own or have an interest in some producing 
properties in the relevant area.  I told Mike that that would be a surprise 
to me, and that EOG, which is the Enron entity that typically owns such 
interests, was spun off last year.  Mike said he would take another look to 
see why they thought ENA would have such information.

The trial date is one year out, and this is apparently the first round of 
discovery.  Mike would not be surprised if we got a call from Questar's 
attorneys, requesting the same information.

Noone faxed to me the proposed subpoenas, with the understanding that I was 
not authorized to accept service for them.  I will send copies to each of 
you.  Let me know if you would like the Unit to handle or assist in the 
handling of this.

Could you look at the invoice and verify that the park & loan service is 
really non-pathed for Iroquis contract 125099.

Unify has contract 125099 as pathed.  The pipe says they are non-pathed on 
this service.

If this needs to be changed, could you get Global to add this, and let the 
Scheduler know about the nom basis/model type addition.  The Scheduler's are 
Molly LaFuze and Victor LaMadrid.

Thanks, Diane

2) If we elect to change Unify's model type to pathed, let's do it just like 
we did Southern Natural.  And, I would like this done for May 1 noms in 
production and have the Scheduler (Beverly?) path in this new model type 
manner.  We are suppose to be getting scheduled quantities in production 
starting tomorrow, unless ECOM prevents it, so you'll be able to see what the 
pipe expects in the pathed model type.
3) If we elect to NOT change Unify's model type to pathed, I guess we can't 
ever edi this pipe unless I can figure out some clever way to join up the 
noms.

Beverly, Do you think it would be a problem to start entering the upstream 
k's and downstream k's when you path in Unify.  The pipe told me this is 
mandatory data unless the nom is involved in the Appalachian area.  If it is 
a problem, don't do, I don't want to slow you down since you have to enter 
the data twice today.  If and when we do edi, we'll need the up/down k's 
entered at that time.

k's and downstream k's when you path in Unify.  The pipe told me this is 
mandatory data unless the nom is involved in the Appalachian area.  If it is 
a problem, don't do, I don't want to slow you down since you have to enter 
the data twice today.  If and when we do edi, we'll need the up/down k's 
entered at that time.

Could you look at the invoice and verify that the park & loan service is 
really non-pathed for Iroquis contract 125099.

Unify has contract 125099 as pathed.  The pipe says they are non-pathed on

If this needs to be changed, could you get Global to add this, and let the

John,
Thanks for stopping by.  For pre-paids and the like we have an expediated 
DASH process.  Since the counterparty is National Steel, we will need to get 
credit involved.  I've included Chip on this email regarding costs of funds.  

The expediated DASH process is for financings of embedded in commodity 
transactions.  This is to ensure that these type of transactions are reviewed 
considering funds flow and the ability to syndicate, as well as credit, 
documentation, and pricing.  This process is intended to be less 
comprehensive than a standard DASH and is to be used only for embedded 
financing transactions that are either (i) short- term or (ii) longer-term if 
with relatively highly-rated counterparties.


Thanks,

Frank

The structure is critical. I don't want to cash out the entire fixed price 
position and then turn around and sell them index gas at $8.  Then I have a 
huge receivable risk that has no MTM offset.  I'd rather reset the fixed 
price to somwhere in between, especially if they are hurting for cash.

I'm unclear, but evidently we sold $2 dollar gas to them (back in 1996) and 
they are asking to cash out...I think we end up paying them roughly 20 
million dollars.  I'll give you better/more details as I learn them.

Commodity Transactions


John,
Thanks for stopping by.  For pre-paids and the like we have an expediated 
DASH process.  Since the counterparty is National Steel, we will need to get 
credit involved.  I've included Chip on this email regarding costs of funds.  

The expediated DASH process is for financings of embedded in commodity 
transactions.  This is to ensure that these type of transactions are reviewed 
considering funds flow and the ability to syndicate, as well as credit, 
documentation, and pricing.  This process is intended to be less 
comprehensive than a standard DASH and is to be used only for embedded 
financing transactions that are either (i) short- term or (ii) longer-term if 
with relatively highly-rated counterparties.


Thanks,

Frank

Hi Mark,

There will be a one-day WRMA conference here (Morten Erik and Mark Tawney
are involved in these arrangements and Mr. Wani, lawyer of local derivative
fame will be talking at the conference) in late Feb or early March.  Date
will be fixed later this week, likely to be March 5.

there may be an energy seminar in March or April in Tokyo.  Have you heard

Subject: Proposed Changes to Business Practices Based on the California 
Energy Crisis

Over the past several months, we have reviewed in detail our trading 
contracts and the companies through which we conduct our trading business in 
California.  In order to reduce Enron's non-market risks ( e.g. legal, credit 
and regulatory) in the volatile commodity markets in California or any "" 
future California"", we propose the following changes:

1.    Mandatory Uniform Set-Off Provisions in All Trading Contracts for All 
Commodities -- set-off language varies commodity by commodity in trading 
contracts.  Set-off is one of the most critical tools available to Enron in a 
major default situation and it is critical to have set-off language and to 
have it be uniform commodity to commodity so that Enron can get the best 
advantage from set-off and not just the least common denominator.

2.     Master Netting Agreements For Appropriate Counterparties With Multiple 
Masters With Significant Opposite Exposures -- where it is necessary to have 
multiple masters with a counterparty, a ""bridge"" should be put in place 
between the masters whenever there is significant opposite exposures under 
the two or more masters.

3.     Merge EPMI into ENA -- power trades are done through EPMI.  Merging 
EPMI into ENA and conducting power trades through ENA is much more efficient 
from both a credit and legal point of view.

4.     No Automatic Termination for a Bankruptcy Event -- in the PGE/SCE 
situation, it should be the non-defaulting party's (Enron in this case) 
option to terminate rather than an automatic termination on ""inability to pay 
debts as they become due"".

Let me know if you have any other proposed changes to our trading contracts 
or entities through which we conduct our trading.  I believe these changes 
will (i) improve efficiency, (ii) reduce risks, (iii) develop the opportunity 
to do more business with certain counterparties and (iv) substantially 
improve Enron's position in the next California type market.  The long range 
goal is to conduct as much as possible of the trading business through a 
single entity and a single or limited number of standardized agreements.

Joe R. will be sending out something in greater detail shortly, but it 
appears that Equilon's management would like to pursue a deal with us on an 
exclusive basis and that this decision is being forwarded to the Equilon 
Board for approval.  If this acquisition goes forward, we will need to get 
organized---in the near term---on a number of logistical/due diligence tasks, 
but one thing we should start thinking about now is the ""disclosure"" issue.

If the Equilon Board gives the go-ahead for Equilon to pursue this 
transaction , Equilon will probably want  to sign a memorandum of 
understanding with us, and this may put us in a ""disclosure"" posture because 
at that point, we would be looking at a $65 million deal (approx.) with a 
closure probability of no less than 20% (in my judgment, based upon our past 
dealings with these people).  Even without a signed document, the 
""size/probability"" test would still be an issue for us to deal with.  
Everyone should be thinking about this issue as we await word from Equilon's 
Board. Thanks.   SWD

Subject: Some Background on California Gas Price Spikes--The Other Side of 
the Story

Last week, I distributed a presentation that the Brattle Group gave before 
the California Inquisition (i.e., legislative gas oversight committee looking 
into the gas price spikes at the Cal border).  

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up 
on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned 
power plants).  Edison ""arranged"" for the Brattle Group to be the star 
witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing.  Their job was to set up El Paso and 
Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day.  Their 
message was simple (and simplistic):

El Paso and Dynegy have market power.
They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas 
at the border (to ""obscene"" levels).
That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices.

Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide 
the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets 
any questions on the topic.  It's attached.  Apologies, it's quick and dirty, 
but it provides the basics.

Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to 
offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California 
Legislature is peddling.

Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the 
California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis 
when ENA controlled a portion of  the capacity), but the overriding goal of 
the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.

Best,
Jeff

Subject: Some Background on California Gas Price Spikes--The Other Side of 
the Story

Last week, I distributed a presentation that the Brattle Group gave before 
the California Inquisition (i.e., legislative gas oversight committee looking 
into the gas price spikes at the Cal border).  

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up 
on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned 
power plants).  Edison ""arranged"" for the Brattle Group to be the star 
witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing.  Their job was to set up El Paso and 
Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day.  Their 
message was simple (and simplistic):

El Paso and Dynegy have market power.
They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas 
at the border (to ""obscene"" levels).
That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices.

Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide 
the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets 
any questions on the topic.  It's attached.  Apologies, it's quick and dirty, 
but it provides the basics.

Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to 
offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California 
Legislature is peddling.

Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the 
California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis 
when ENA controlled a portion of  the capacity), but the overriding goal of 
the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.

Best,
Jeff

Be careful using IMC Canada to prepare your draft from.  Even though we have 
chosen NY law, we had two Canadian companies entering into the IMC Canada 
agreement so there is language in the agreement that is Canadian specific, 
and it might be missing some required US language.  I have also attached a 
redlined draft reflecting the negotiated changes to the form since the form 
we first sent the form to the counterparty.   I have attached our current 
form of ISDA Schedule as a reference.  The Canadian changes will be color 
coded, so you can see them easily.

Also, please note:  there have been recent amendments to the CFTC Rules that 
have required certain changes to the swap reps, in particular there are no 
longer ""eligible swap participants"",  the current terminology is ""eligible 
contract participant"".  Please see Part 5(b) of the Schedule in particular.

Everybody,
Tanya suggested I ask all of you if you know anything related to a hotline 
call I took yesterday afternoon.  I got a call from John Arnold who wanted to 
know who was working on getting an ISDA in place with a subsidiary of 
Citibank. He thought it was a hedge fund, he wasn't sure.  He said that they 
were getting very impatient to start dealing with us.  He left a contact for 
Citibank:  Jerry Peskuchi (212) 723-7065, who wants to be updated on the 
status of the master.
Sorry I didn't bring this up in the morning meeting, but please let me know 
if any of you know anything about this, because I had no idea who to direct 
his call to and could only promise to try and find the right person handling 
this and pass the info on.

Subject: ISDA with Citibank Subsidiary
Everybody,
Tanya suggested I ask all of you if you know anything related to a hotline 
call I took yesterday afternoon.  I got a call from John Arnold who wanted to 
know who was working on getting an ISDA in place with a subsidiary of 
Citibank. He thought it was a hedge fund, he wasn't sure.  He said that they 
were getting very impatient to start dealing with us.  He left a contact for 
Citibank:  Jerry Peskuchi (212) 723-7065, who wants to be updated on the 
status of the master.

Subject: ISDA with Citibank Subsidiary
Everybody,
Tanya suggested I ask all of you if you know anything related to a hotline 
call I took yesterday afternoon.  I got a call from John Arnold who wanted to 
know who was working on getting an ISDA in place with a subsidiary of 
Citibank. He thought it was a hedge fund, he wasn't sure.  He said that they 
were getting very impatient to start dealing with us.  He left a contact for 
Citibank:  Jerry Peskuchi (212) 723-7065, who wants to be updated on the 
status of the master.
Sorry I didn't bring this up in the morning meeting, but please let me know

Be careful using IMC Canada to prepare your draft from.  Even though we have

Also, please note:  there have been recent amendments to the CFTC Rules that

Be careful using IMC Canada to prepare your draft from.  Even though we have 
chosen NY law, we had two Canadian companies entering into the IMC Canada 
agreement so there is language in the agreement that is Canadian specific, 
and it might be missing some required US language.  I have also attached a 
redlined draft reflecting the negotiated changes to the form since the form 
we first sent the form to the counterparty.   I have attached our current 
form of ISDA Schedule as a reference.  The Canadian changes will be color 
coded, so you can see them easily.

Also, please note:  there have been recent amendments to the CFTC Rules that 
have required certain changes to the swap reps, in particular there are no

Vince,

I got feedback from the lunchtime research meeting that you were talking 
about some specific solutions to performance of IT systems... In particular 
distributed processing. Also I heard that you had concerns about the use of 
multiple languages etc....

Both of these sound like what I was discussing with you on previous 
occasions... Do you feel the need to discuss these further?

The multi-language issue isn't really that much of an issue, as the current 
system is 98% java right now. Although I am a big fan of C/C++(it is my main 
development skill) , I am also very aware that Java is a much more evolved 
and robust language. I had serious doubts about the performance, but I've had 
a review conducted, and the results are showing the Sun Unix implementation 
to be nearly as fast and in some cases faster than C/C++ because of something 
they call Hot-Spot technology. (its an instruction caching technique, I 
believe). The concerns I expressed to you, were really about how technical 
people justify the use of a language on the strength of a relatively 
meaningless metric like portability.

On the issue of distributed processing... the original review I had conducted 
by our architecture group pointed to that as a solution, and as Zhiyong Wei 
is already working on Global Valuation project, Winston is actively working 
with Zhiyong to see if he can model the VaR architecture on that, and also to 
find a common Valuation piece between the systems.

I'd like the opportunity to talk to you about these issues if you have some 
time over the next few days?

Also, I sat in on the Tanya / Winston meeting yesterday and as per our 
discussion at the elevator, I attempted to help her argument by suggesting to 
all present that she was trying to perform triage on the code... I.e. 
Seperating research domain problems from IT problems.

She said that stepping through code was the only real way in which she could 
get a feel for where performance bottlenecks were. I asked her how she would 
measure that, and she said she would instrument the code manually by 
inserting timing elements at strategic points. I mentioned that a profiling 
tool could probably do this job for her. Tanya again said that stepping 
through code is the only way she can get an idea of the code, and that 
studying documentation wasn't enough. 

About 6 weeks ago, I commissioned a team to document the system down to 
psuedo-code level and will be able to provide this to you and your team soon. 
(in fact I've asked for a draft copy to be given to Tanya right now), and 
Winston is also working on a draft Research/IT ""working together"" document, 
which will identify how the exchange of information takes place.

Tanya also gave the impression that she wants a dedicated IT developer to do 
all the environment setup for her, because she doesn't really want to have to 
do that. I think that this is probably the root cause of the issue. The IT 
guys are working very hard and her handling of the situation is not good, as 
it gives the impression that this kind of work is beneath her. She is 
claiming that they are un-cooperative.... they are claiming that she 
continually asks the same questions about set-up over and over again, and 
doesn't seem to want to learn how to do it. Winston on the other hand, could 
be more proactive in determining what is a business related model issue and 
an IT issue and ask for help from research.

I think you Debbie and I need to work quite hard to get them to play nicely.

I have asked Tanya and Winston to go ahead and work very closely together 
over the next few days....and Debbie Brackett and I will review their 
progress on Friday. 

In the meantime l'll be looking at setting up a working test environment that 
doesn't involve my main Quant guys in day to to day setup issues as a longer 
term solution.

",True
-17460.0,"Hi Vince,

 Nelson and I had a meeting yesterday with the Ag Desk folks on how to go 
forward on the analysis and presentation for this program.  The consensus 
from the Ag side was that the choice of university will be highly politically 
driven, ie preferably the university should be from a state that has close 
ties to sympathetic senators or other political figures.  Also it is 
preferable if the university faculty have worked on Ag issues before, lending 
more credibility in the Ag community.  The names that came up were 
Mississippi State and Texas A&M.  Nelson knows of a person at Mississippi 
State who worked with the USDA on risk management issues.
 The needed analysis itself is not necessarily very deep, and the focus is 
primarily to get a non-quantitative presentation out that outlines how Enron 
can take on the downside risk of local crop prices (Enron probably needs to 
cover actual local prices and not simply an index because I do not think the 
govt will want to worry about basis risk). 
 The pilot program itself will be very small, and lends itself to continuing 
down the path of short term trading rather than long term origination.  
Another thought on hedging our potential short positon (on the origination 
side) is that the govt program can only provide a partial hedge to the extent 
of the premium received -- we still have unlimited downside from the short.

p.s. I am writing up Jim Bouillion's project suggestion as a potential

While trying to put  together the agreements for D-G Energy, I have an 
additional question:

I need to know exactly what yall plan to do with the Source Code once you 
have it after the initial one year period is up?  There are still limitations 
as to what you can do with it, so I will need to know so we can try to revise 
the contract so that you will be legal.  

For example, in the language regarding release of the source code from 
escrow, it states that once you have the source code, you just have the 
""right to use, copy and modify the Source Code, solely for our internal 
purposes in connection with support, maintenance and operation of the 
Software"".

Do yall plan to reverse engineer, decompile, etc?  Do you plan on using any 
of their code to create our own product?  If so - I think these are going to 
be a problem.  The latter would be an infringement issue, unless we were to 
contract to do so.

proceed in this area.

Subject: Moody's Upgrade
To the great and powerful Research Group:
As you may know, Moody's has recently upgraded Enron from Baa2 to Baa1.
We had been on watch for an upgrade for a while and after their intitial 
credit meeting, they still had questions primarily related to our control of 
market and credit risk.  To that end, Jeff McMahon and Tim Despain had Rick 
Buy, Bill Bradford and I meet with eight members of the Moody's team.  The 
questions centered around policy and procedure in the Wholesale businesses.  
We discussed VAR, stress testing and potential credit exposure.  To make a 
long story short, subsequent to that meeting, they reconvened their committee 
and announced the upgrade.  
I want you to know how critical your contribution was to the discussion and 
will continue to be as the bar gets raised.  I am sure that next year they 
will continue to be concerned with our risk management capabilities as well 
as extensions of our current platform - tail risk, intra day risk, 
operational risk, and enterprise wide risk.
Thank you for your efforts in supporting RAC - it has tangible benefits.

While trying to put  together the agreements for D-G Energy, I have an

I need to know exactly what yall plan to do with the Source Code once you 
have it after the initial one year period is up?  There are still limitations 
as to what you can do with it, so I will need to know so we can try to revise 
the contract so that you will be legal.  

For example, in the language regarding release of the source code from 
escrow, it states that once you have the source code, you just have the 
""right to use, copy and modify the Source Code, solely for our internal 
purposes in connection with support, maintenance and operation of the 
Software"".

Do yall plan to reverse engineer, decompile, etc?  Do you plan on using any 
of their code to create our own product?  If so - I think these are going to 
be a problem.  The latter would be an infringement issue, unless we were to 
contract to do so.  

Please let me know more details of your plan so I can see how we need to 
proceed in this area.

Vince,

I got feedback from the lunchtime research meeting that you were talking 
about some specific solutions to performance of IT systems... In particular 
distributed processing. Also I heard that you had concerns about the use of 
multiple languages etc....

Both of these sound like what I was discussing with you on previous 
occasions... Do you feel the need to discuss these further?

The multi-language issue isn't really that much of an issue, as the current 
system is 98% java right now. Although I am a big fan of C/C++(it is my main 
development skill) , I am also very aware that Java is a much more evolved 
and robust language. I had serious doubts about the performance, but I've had 
a review conducted, and the results are showing the Sun Unix implementation 
to be nearly as fast and in some cases faster than C/C++ because of something 
they call Hot-Spot technology. (its an instruction caching technique, I 
believe). The concerns I expressed to you, were really about how technical 
people justify the use of a language on the strength of a relatively 
meaningless metric like portability.

On the issue of distributed processing... the original review I had conducted 
by our architecture group pointed to that as a solution, and as Zhiyong Wei 
is already working on Global Valuation project, Winston is actively working 
with Zhiyong to see if he can model the VaR architecture on that, and also to 
find a common Valuation piece between the systems.

I'd like the opportunity to talk to you about these issues if you have some 
time over the next few days?

Also, I sat in on the Tanya / Winston meeting yesterday and as per our 
discussion at the elevator, I attempted to help her argument by suggesting to 
all present that she was trying to perform triage on the code... I.e. 
Seperating research domain problems from IT problems.

She said that stepping through code was the only real way in which she could 
get a feel for where performance bottlenecks were. I asked her how she would 
measure that, and she said she would instrument the code manually by 
inserting timing elements at strategic points. I mentioned that a profiling 
tool could probably do this job for her. Tanya again said that stepping 
through code is the only way she can get an idea of the code, and that 
studying documentation wasn't enough. 

About 6 weeks ago, I commissioned a team to document the system down to 
psuedo-code level and will be able to provide this to you and your team soon. 
(in fact I've asked for a draft copy to be given to Tanya right now), and 
Winston is also working on a draft Research/IT ""working together"" document, 
which will identify how the exchange of information takes place.

Tanya also gave the impression that she wants a dedicated IT developer to do 
all the environment setup for her, because she doesn't really want to have to 
do that. I think that this is probably the root cause of the issue. The IT 
guys are working very hard and her handling of the situation is not good, as 
it gives the impression that this kind of work is beneath her. She is 
claiming that they are un-cooperative.... they are claiming that she 
continually asks the same questions about set-up over and over again, and 
doesn't seem to want to learn how to do it. Winston on the other hand, could 
be more proactive in determining what is a business related model issue and 
an IT issue and ask for help from research.

I think you Debbie and I need to work quite hard to get them to play nicely.

I have asked Tanya and Winston to go ahead and work very closely together 
over the next few days....and Debbie Brackett and I will review their 
progress on Friday. 

In the meantime l'll be looking at setting up a working test environment that 
doesn't involve my main Quant guys in day to to day setup issues as a longer 
term solution.

Subject: Moody's Upgrade
To the great and powerful Research Group:
As you may know, Moody's has recently upgraded Enron from Baa2 to Baa1.
We had been on watch for an upgrade for a while and after their intitial 
credit meeting, they still had questions primarily related to our control of 
market and credit risk.  To that end, Jeff McMahon and Tim Despain had Rick 
Buy, Bill Bradford and I meet with eight members of the Moody's team.  The 
questions centered around policy and procedure in the Wholesale businesses.  
We discussed VAR, stress testing and potential credit exposure.  To make a 
long story short, subsequent to that meeting, they reconvened their committee 
and announced the upgrade.  
I want you to know how critical your contribution was to the discussion and 
will continue to be as the bar gets raised.  I am sure that next year they 
will continue to be concerned with our risk management capabilities as well 
as extensions of our current platform - tail risk, intra day risk, 
operational risk, and enterprise wide risk.
Thank you for your efforts in supporting RAC - it has tangible benefits.

what did you think of David Hsu?

My thoughts.

Overall a good guy. Personable. Intelligent.

He could communicate reasonably well, but seemed to be capable of losing 
objectivity in favour of technical advancement.

He didn't seem comfortable with taking a man-management role (at least he 
didn't want to be an 'administrator')

He appeared to know a lot about risk. (In fact Jay Web called me to say he 
felt David was one of the better risk guys he had seen but also commented 
that he needed to be coupled with a project manager to be successfull).

Vince,

I got feedback from the lunchtime research meeting that you were talking 
about some specific solutions to performance of IT systems... In particular 
distributed processing. Also I heard that you had concerns about the use of 
multiple languages etc....

Both of these sound like what I was discussing with you on previous 
occasions... Do you feel the need to discuss these further?

The multi-language issue isn't really that much of an issue, as the current 
system is 98% java right now. Although I am a big fan of C/C++(it is my main 
development skill) , I am also very aware that Java is a much more evolved 
and robust language. I had serious doubts about the performance, but I've had 
a review conducted, and the results are showing the Sun Unix implementation 
to be nearly as fast and in some cases faster than C/C++ because of something 
they call Hot-Spot technology. (its an instruction caching technique, I 
believe). The concerns I expressed to you, were really about how technical 
people justify the use of a language on the strength of a relatively 
meaningless metric like portability.

On the issue of distributed processing... the original review I had conducted 
by our architecture group pointed to that as a solution, and as Zhiyong Wei 
is already working on Global Valuation project, Winston is actively working 
with Zhiyong to see if he can model the VaR architecture on that, and also to 
find a common Valuation piece between the systems.

I'd like the opportunity to talk to you about these issues if you have some 
time over the next few days?

Also, I sat in on the Tanya / Winston meeting yesterday and as per our 
discussion at the elevator, I attempted to help her argument by suggesting to 
all present that she was trying to perform triage on the code... I.e. 
Seperating research domain problems from IT problems.

She said that stepping through code was the only real way in which she could 
get a feel for where performance bottlenecks were. I asked her how she would 
measure that, and she said she would instrument the code manually by 
inserting timing elements at strategic points. I mentioned that a profiling 
tool could probably do this job for her. Tanya again said that stepping 
through code is the only way she can get an idea of the code, and that 
studying documentation wasn't enough. 

About 6 weeks ago, I commissioned a team to document the system down to 
psuedo-code level and will be able to provide this to you and your team soon. 
(in fact I've asked for a draft copy to be given to Tanya right now), and 
Winston is also working on a draft Research/IT ""working together"" document, 
which will identify how the exchange of information takes place.

Tanya also gave the impression that she wants a dedicated IT developer to do 
all the environment setup for her, because she doesn't really want to have to 
do that. I think that this is probably the root cause of the issue. The IT 
guys are working very hard and her handling of the situation is not good, as 
it gives the impression that this kind of work is beneath her. She is 
claiming that they are un-cooperative.... they are claiming that she 
continually asks the same questions about set-up over and over again, and 
doesn't seem to want to learn how to do it. Winston on the other hand, could 
be more proactive in determining what is a business related model issue and 
an IT issue and ask for help from research.

I think you Debbie and I need to work quite hard to get them to play nicely.

I have asked Tanya and Winston to go ahead and work very closely together 
over the next few days....and Debbie Brackett and I will review their 
progress on Friday. 

In the meantime l'll be looking at setting up a working test environment that 
doesn't involve my main Quant guys in day to to day setup issues as a longer 
term solution.

-17460.0,"Hi Vince,

 Nelson and I had a meeting yesterday with the Ag Desk folks on how to go 
forward on the analysis and presentation for this program.  The consensus 
from the Ag side was that the choice of university will be highly politically 
driven, ie preferably the university should be from a state that has close 
ties to sympathetic senators or other political figures.  Also it is 
preferable if the university faculty have worked on Ag issues before, lending 
more credibility in the Ag community.  The names that came up were 
Mississippi State and Texas A&M.  Nelson knows of a person at Mississippi 
State who worked with the USDA on risk management issues.
 The needed analysis itself is not necessarily very deep, and the focus is 
primarily to get a non-quantitative presentation out that outlines how Enron 
can take on the downside risk of local crop prices (Enron probably needs to 
cover actual local prices and not simply an index because I do not think the 
govt will want to worry about basis risk). 
 The pilot program itself will be very small, and lends itself to continuing 
down the path of short term trading rather than long term origination.  
Another thought on hedging our potential short positon (on the origination 
side) is that the govt program can only provide a partial hedge to the extent 
of the premium received -- we still have unlimited downside from the short.

Good Morning Vince:

1) We met with some geophysical data gathering/transmission people last 
week.  I observed that there is an opportunity to get in the early steps of 
the (oil exploration) energy supply chain - we can get at the key data 
driving oil drilling earlier than anyone else by extending into this area of 
broadband networking - to build a way to hedge oil and other energy trades.  

I asked Adler or Reichardt to present the idea to your team for validation.  
Have they contacted you yet?

2) I'm converting to consultant - I've had a great year here but need to get 
back north more often (family).  I will be converting to consultant status 
starting next week.  Do not hesitate to call me if there is anything I can do 
for you or your team to help out.

I apologize for the delay, but I finally have drafted an Escrow Agreement for 
placing the software in escrow with your attorneys.  Please review and have 
your attorneys review and let me know if it is acceptable.

I will be leaving the department I have been working in and moving to a 
different Enron subsidiary on October 13.  If at all possible, could we try 
to get the Software License Agreement and the Escrow Agreement wrapped up 
before I leave so that someone else does not have to try to pick up where I 
left off?

I think we are just about in agreement on the Software License portion.  
Seems like the only outstanding question had to do with your concern 
regarding providing a response time of 2 business days.  I do not have any 
answers regarding that - maybe Vince Kaminski or Stinson Gibner can respond 
on this issue.

To the great and powerful Research Group:
As you may know, Moody's has recently upgraded Enron from Baa2 to Baa1.
We had been on watch for an upgrade for a while and after their intitial 
credit meeting, they still had questions primarily related to our control of 
market and credit risk.  To that end, Jeff McMahon and Tim Despain had Rick 
Buy, Bill Bradford and I meet with eight members of the Moody's team.  The 
questions centered around policy and procedure in the Wholesale businesses.  
We discussed VAR, stress testing and potential credit exposure.  To make a 
long story short, subsequent to that meeting, they reconvened their committee 
and announced the upgrade.  
I want you to know how critical your contribution was to the discussion and 
will continue to be as the bar gets raised.  I am sure that next year they 
will continue to be concerned with our risk management capabilities as well 
as extensions of our current platform - tail risk, intra day risk, 
operational risk, and enterprise wide risk.

 Nelson and I had a meeting yesterday with the Ag Desk folks on how to go 
forward on the analysis and presentation for this program.  The consensus 
from the Ag side was that the choice of university will be highly politically 
driven, ie preferably the university should be from a state that has close 
ties to sympathetic senators or other political figures.  Also it is 
preferable if the university faculty have worked on Ag issues before, lending 
more credibility in the Ag community.  The names that came up were 
Mississippi State and Texas A&M.  Nelson knows of a person at Mississippi 
State who worked with the USDA on risk management issues.
 The needed analysis itself is not necessarily very deep, and the focus is 
primarily to get a non-quantitative presentation out that outlines how Enron 
can take on the downside risk of local crop prices (Enron probably needs to 
cover actual local prices and not simply an index because I do not think the 
govt will want to worry about basis risk). 
 The pilot program itself will be very small, and lends itself to continuing 
down the path of short term trading rather than long term origination.  
Another thought on hedging our potential short positon (on the origination 
side) is that the govt program can only provide a partial hedge to the extent 
of the premium received -- we still have unlimited downside from the short.

Below is a brief summary of near-term projects for the enhancement of VAR and 
the use of VAR.  As you can tell some are not directly Research issues (some 
require the guidance but not direct work product), and are very North 
American Wholesale-centric.    
Vince,
I think that the only one in which progress requires your input to get kick 
started is #5.  All others are in progress with Tanya/Grant involved through 
Jeff Shankman's regular meeting.
We would like to get your input as to your priorities (we were thinking Top 
5?) and then start knocking some of them out.  It is not meant to be 
exhaustive and is focused on fixes as opposed to overhauls. 
Thanks

Ted
Rick Buy, John Lavorato and I met to discuss priorities as it relates to the 
calculation of VAR.  We are making the following recommendations
 1) Inclusion of monthly index positions into VAR calculations as the 
indicies set in North American Natural Gas
 2) Development of a methodology to re-run correlations (factor loadings) 
including criteria, responsibilities and acceptance/rejection criteria
 3) Development of process by which to analyze the output of factor loading 
process.  Database to store output and management reports.
 4) Finalize debate on the calculation of Forward/Forward volatility
 5) Scope a project to analyze the possibility of calculating hourly 
volatility for power.
It was further recommended that we continue to not include unpriced index 
positions in VAR calculation.

Vince,

I got feedback from the lunchtime research meeting that you were talking 
about some specific solutions to performance of IT systems... In particular 
distributed processing. Also I heard that you had concerns about the use of 
multiple languages etc....

Both of these sound like what I was discussing with you on previous 
occasions... Do you feel the need to discuss these further?

The multi-language issue isn't really that much of an issue, as the current 
system is 98% java right now. Although I am a big fan of C/C++(it is my main 
development skill) , I am also very aware that Java is a much more evolved 
and robust language. I had serious doubts about the performance, but I've had 
a review conducted, and the results are showing the Sun Unix implementation 
to be nearly as fast and in some cases faster than C/C++ because of something 
they call Hot-Spot technology. (its an instruction caching technique, I 
believe). The concerns I expressed to you, were really about how technical 
people justify the use of a language on the strength of a relatively 
meaningless metric like portability.

On the issue of distributed processing... the original review I had conducted 
by our architecture group pointed to that as a solution, and as Zhiyong Wei 
is already working on Global Valuation project, Winston is actively working 
with Zhiyong to see if he can model the VaR architecture on that, and also to 
find a common Valuation piece between the systems.

I'd like the opportunity to talk to you about these issues if you have some 
time over the next few days?

Also, I sat in on the Tanya / Winston meeting yesterday and as per our 
discussion at the elevator, I attempted to help her argument by suggesting to 
all present that she was trying to perform triage on the code... I.e. 
Seperating research domain problems from IT problems.

She said that stepping through code was the only real way in which she could 
get a feel for where performance bottlenecks were. I asked her how she would 
measure that, and she said she would instrument the code manually by 
inserting timing elements at strategic points. I mentioned that a profiling 
tool could probably do this job for her. Tanya again said that stepping 
through code is the only way she can get an idea of the code, and that 
studying documentation wasn't enough. 

About 6 weeks ago, I commissioned a team to document the system down to 
psuedo-code level and will be able to provide this to you and your team soon. 
(in fact I've asked for a draft copy to be given to Tanya right now), and 
Winston is also working on a draft Research/IT ""working together"" document, 
which will identify how the exchange of information takes place.

Tanya also gave the impression that she wants a dedicated IT developer to do 
all the environment setup for her, because she doesn't really want to have to 
do that. I think that this is probably the root cause of the issue. The IT 
guys are working very hard and her handling of the situation is not good, as 
it gives the impression that this kind of work is beneath her. She is 
claiming that they are un-cooperative.... they are claiming that she 
continually asks the same questions about set-up over and over again, and 
doesn't seem to want to learn how to do it. Winston on the other hand, could 
be more proactive in determining what is a business related model issue and 
an IT issue and ask for help from research.

I think you Debbie and I need to work quite hard to get them to play nicely.

I have asked Tanya and Winston to go ahead and work very closely together 
over the next few days....and Debbie Brackett and I will review their 
progress on Friday. 

In the meantime l'll be looking at setting up a working test environment that 
doesn't involve my main Quant guys in day to to day setup issues as a longer 
term solution.

Steve

appropriate for employees in some of the specialized technical and technical 
areas.  I would appreciate your input on this so that, if possible and time 
permitting, we can try to tailor the form to suit needs across the 
organization.  

One simple solution may be to add a skills/behaviors block requesting  
evaluation and feedback on the employees specific job and performance, 
another solution would be to add job specific behaviors and descriptors to 
the list of those already developed (second attachment below).  I would 
welcome your thoughts and a few moments of your time to chat with you about 
this. 

   




Many Thanks,

1. Would it be possible to get Gappy a cell phone for the summer? He does not 
have a phone at home. I think the reason for avoiding installing a phone in 
his apartment is the increasing cost of his Houston stay.

Subject: Moody's Upgrade
To the great and powerful Research Group:
As you may know, Moody's has recently upgraded Enron from Baa2 to Baa1.
We had been on watch for an upgrade for a while and after their intitial 
credit meeting, they still had questions primarily related to our control of 
market and credit risk.  To that end, Jeff McMahon and Tim Despain had Rick 
Buy, Bill Bradford and I meet with eight members of the Moody's team.  The 
questions centered around policy and procedure in the Wholesale businesses.  
We discussed VAR, stress testing and potential credit exposure.  To make a 
long story short, subsequent to that meeting, they reconvened their committee 
and announced the upgrade.  
I want you to know how critical your contribution was to the discussion and 
will continue to be as the bar gets raised.  I am sure that next year they 
will continue to be concerned with our risk management capabilities as well 
as extensions of our current platform - tail risk, intra day risk, 
operational risk, and enterprise wide risk.
Thank you for your efforts in supporting RAC - it has tangible benefits.

Subject: Some Background on California Gas Price Spikes--The Other Side of 
the Story

Last week, I distributed a presentation that the Brattle Group gave before 
the California Inquisition (i.e., legislative gas oversight committee looking 
into the gas price spikes at the Cal border).  

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up 
on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned 
power plants).  Edison ""arranged"" for the Brattle Group to be the star 
witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing.  Their job was to set up El Paso and 
Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day.  Their 
message was simple (and simplistic):

El Paso and Dynegy have market power.
They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas 
at the border (to ""obscene"" levels).
That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices.

Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide 
the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets 
any questions on the topic.  It's attached.  Apologies, it's quick and dirty, 
but it provides the basics.

Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to 
offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California 
Legislature is peddling.

Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the 
California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis 
when ENA controlled a portion of  the capacity), but the overriding goal of 
the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.

Best,
Jeff

Subject: Some Background on California Gas Price Spikes--The Other Side of 
the Story

Last week, I distributed a presentation that the Brattle Group gave before 
the California Inquisition (i.e., legislative gas oversight committee looking 
into the gas price spikes at the Cal border).  

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up 
on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned 
power plants).  Edison ""arranged"" for the Brattle Group to be the star 
witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing.  Their job was to set up El Paso and 
Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day.  Their 
message was simple (and simplistic):

El Paso and Dynegy have market power.
They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas 
at the border (to ""obscene"" levels).
That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices.

Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide 
the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets 
any questions on the topic.  It's attached.  Apologies, it's quick and dirty, 
but it provides the basics.

Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to 
offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California 
Legislature is peddling.

Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the 
California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis 
when ENA controlled a portion of  the capacity), but the overriding goal of 
the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.

Best,
Jeff

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up

any questions on the topic.  It's attached.  Apologies, it's quick and dirty, 
but it provides the basics.

Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to 
offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California 
Legislature is peddling.

Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the 
California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis 
when ENA controlled a portion of  the capacity), but the overriding goal of 
the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.

As you know, we've been working for about an eternity to unbundle SoCalGas'=

system.  90+% of the industry agreed to an unbundling solution and filed it=

as a settlement at the Commission.  In opposition, muni generators and TURN=

(SoCalGas eventually came over to our side, as did Southern California=20

A judge's proposed decision came out the day before Thanksgiving adopting t=

If it weren't for the continual barrage of retrograde policy pronouncements=
=20
coming from the ""new"" California PUC, folks would be genuinely shocked by t=
he=20
judge's proposed decision, but as things are, it was somewhat expected.

There's one silver lining:  We managed to get in both settlements an=20
identical provision that eliminates a substantial amount of financial risk =
TW=20

It does considerable harm, however, when compared to the significant value=

that would have been created if the judge adopted the the unbundling=20
settlement.

We have a chance to go on the record in a trade publication ""California=20

this Commission is doing in managing California's energy policy.  I'm=20
squarely on the fence at this point and am seeking feedback.  A proposed=20
comment is attached. =20

Two questions:

1) Do folks think that there's value in providing a comment?

2) If so, does this statement work, or do folks have suggestions?

Subject: Some Background on California Gas Price Spikes--The Other Side of 
the Story

Last week, I distributed a presentation that the Brattle Group gave before 
the California Inquisition (i.e., legislative gas oversight committee looking 
into the gas price spikes at the Cal border).  

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up 
on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned 
power plants).  Edison ""arranged"" for the Brattle Group to be the star 
witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing.  Their job was to set up El Paso and 
Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day.  Their 
message was simple (and simplistic):

El Paso and Dynegy have market power.
They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas 
at the border (to ""obscene"" levels).
That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices.

Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide 
the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets 
any questions on the topic.  It's attached.  Apologies, it's quick and dirty, 
but it provides the basics.

Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to 
offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California 
Legislature is peddling.

Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the 
California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis 
when ENA controlled a portion of  the capacity), but the overriding goal of 
the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.

Best,
Jeff

Subject: Some Background on California Gas Price Spikes--The Other Side of 
the Story

Last week, I distributed a presentation that the Brattle Group gave before 
the California Inquisition (i.e., legislative gas oversight committee looking 
into the gas price spikes at the Cal border).  

The Brattle Group is a consulting firm that Edison has long used to beat up 
on SoCalGas (recall that Edison used to be a big gas customer when it owned 
power plants).  Edison ""arranged"" for the Brattle Group to be the star 
witness at the Cal Leg gas hearing.  Their job was to set up El Paso and 
Dynegy for the hit at hearings that took place the following day.  Their 
message was simple (and simplistic):

El Paso and Dynegy have market power.
They have used the market power to drive up basis and thus the price of gas 
at the border (to ""obscene"" levels).
That, in turn, has driven up electricity prices.

Ken Lay is giving a gas talk tomorrow, and Rob Bradley asked that I provide 
the alternative view to the Edison/Brattle rant, in the event that he gets 
any questions on the topic.  It's attached.  Apologies, it's quick and dirty, 
but it provides the basics.

Obviously no need for us to defend El Paso or Dynegy, but might be useful to 
offer a more rationale explanation than the one that the California 
Legislature is peddling.

Finally, we were also fingered somewhat as culprits at the hearing (the 
California PUC FERC lawyer claimed that ENA and TW colluded to drive up basis 
when ENA controlled a portion of  the capacity), but the overriding goal of 
the hearing was to go after EP and Dynegy.

Best,
Jeff

Problems with tagging on to existing commercials, though.  In a thirty second

development, corporate image, etc.  

We may want to look into producing a specific recruiting spot.  That would be 
an interesting proposition.  If the idea has commercial merit, we could find 
a way to fund it.  Also, EBS has a new unit called Enron Media Services that 
might be able to help us source the media inventory (need to be a specific 
target) to run the spot.

together.  Unfortunately, the process was slowed when our primary contact at 
Smith Graham, Gabriel Hayes, left the firm earlier this year.  We have since 
reestablished discussions and the Global Finance Group is preparing a 
proposal that a portion (about $30 million) of the Enron Cash Balance Plan 
portfolio be dedicated to an emerging managers portfolio.  One-third of this 
money ($10 million) would be invested in bonds, which could be placed with 
Smith Graham, as the fixed-income manager .  (Total Plan assets are about 
$235 million.)

The proposal will be submitted to the Plan Administrative Committee at its 
quarterly meeting on May 3rd.  The proposal should be well received as the 
Committiee has previously requested that  we optimize our existing allocation 
to minority money managers.  Gerald Smith has been advised that Enron is 
looking at ways to allocate money to the firm, and that a decision should be 
reached sometime in May.  We have not communicated the specific details of 
our intentions as of yet pending the outcome of the May 3rd meeting.

835800.0,"Over the past few months, Enron Global Finance has been evaluating various 
opportunities where Enron and Smith Graham & Company may be able to work 
together.  Unfortunately, the process was slowed when our primary contact at 
Smith Graham, Gabriel Hayes, left the firm earlier this year.  We have since 
reestablished discussions and the Global Finance Group is preparing a 
proposal that a portion (about $30 million) of the Enron Cash Balance Plan 
portfolio be dedicated to an emerging managers portfolio.  One-third of this 
money ($10 million) would be invested in bonds, which could be placed with 
Smith Graham, as the fixed-income manager .  (Total Plan assets are about 
$235 million.)

The proposal will be submitted to the Plan Administrative Committee at its 
quarterly meeting on May 3rd.  The proposal should be well received as the 
Committiee has previously requested that  we optimize our existing allocation 
to minority money managers.  Gerald Smith has been advised that Enron is 
looking at ways to allocate money to the firm, and that a decision should be 
reached sometime in May.  We have not communicated the specific details of 
our intentions as of yet pending the outcome of the May 3rd meeting.

I am available for further discussion at your convenience.

contract.

Here's a general description of the steps:

Letter agreement signed
Final form of break out presented to purchaser (not executed by Enron LLC)
$ deposited in escrow
TurboPark notice given

Closing date:

TurboPark closing docs signed (bill of sale, assignment & assumption)
LLC signs breakout contract
Amended LLC, other closing docs executed
Money released from escrow to Enron
Enron pays off TurboPark

This is how it worked on the Intergen deal.  I was unsure from your email if 
you see a problem with this process.

Last time I talked with Lee he was anxious to get the break out contract 
signed.  Your plan works fine as long as we can wait to sign the breakout 
contract.

Here's a general description of the steps:

Letter agreement signed
Final form of break out presented to purchaser (not executed by Enron LLC)
$ deposited in escrow
TurboPark notice given

Closing date:

TurboPark closing docs signed (bill of sale, assignment & assumption)
LLC signs breakout contract
Amended LLC, other closing docs executed
Money released from escrow to Enron
Enron pays off TurboPark

This is how it worked on the Intergen deal.  I was unsure from your email if 
you see a problem with this process.

signed.  Your plan works fine as long as we can wait to sign the breakout 
contract.

Here's a general description of the steps:

Letter agreement signed
Final form of break out presented to purchaser (not executed by Enron LLC)
$ deposited in escrow
TurboPark notice given

Closing date:

TurboPark closing docs signed (bill of sale, assignment & assumption)
LLC signs breakout contract
Amended LLC, other closing docs executed
Money released from escrow to Enron
Enron pays off TurboPark

This is how it worked on the Intergen deal.  I was unsure from your email if 
you see a problem with this process.

Subject: Global LNG's Contacts with Japanese Trading Companies, Nissho Iwai 
in Particular

Joe:

Following up on my phone conversation with Morten Erik today and in advance 
of your meetings in Houston next week, I would like to brief you about Enron 
Global LNG's recent contacts with Japanese trading companies.

We have tabled master spot LNG SPAs, in both FOB and ex-ship form, with 
Mitsubishi, Nissho Iwai, Itochu and Mitsui with the objective to discuss, 
negotiate and conclude these contractual arrangements by late fall this year.

Nissho Iwai represents a special case, though.  In addition to our 
discussions on the master spot LNG purchase contracts, we had previously 
talked with NIC about possible access to some of the LNG shipping capacity 
they control.  Also, during my meeting with Nissho Iwai earlier this week, 
they showed keen interest in connecting with Enron Global LNG's team 
developing the U.S. West Coast terminal opportunities.  NIC, with some other 
Japanese partners, has apparently been trying to develop a specific site in 
California (offshore concept) for some time and is now looking for a 
suitable, strong U.S. partner.  There will be an exploratory meeting held on 
this issue in Houston between Kurt Lindahl and NIC representatives (both from 
Tokyo and New York) probably in early June.

Please let me know if you need more information on this subject.

Regards,

Zdenek Gerych

147600.0,"Good Morning Mike!

The next issue of our newsletter is in the works, with a planned distribution 
set for late June. Mark Frevert has requested that the Executive Letter be 
rotated among the presidents of EWS. This is the inside cover message and 
should be 300+ words. I hope that you will be able to squeeze this into your 
busy schedule.

Here is a suggested outline.  If you want to fill in the outline with 
information, I will be happy to turn it into a letter for you.

 I.  An overview of EWS/EGM as we move forward.

 II. A short-term retrospective about EGM activities and successes

           III. Future plans/initiatives for EGM
     (strategic vision of the group, opportunities, expectations, etc.) 

Please feel free to modify as you see fit.  I have attached Greg Whalley's 
letter from our last issue to give you an idea of the format. Let me know if 
there is anything I can do to help you.  I need your letter by June 15, if 
possible.

 
Hope to hear from you soon.

67440.0,"Jeff and Mike,

Some of our employees in NY have asked whether we would be offering the same 
Health Club reimbursement as what Enron Metals offers in NY.

Ultimately, it is a business cost, not an HR decision.  Metals reimburses up 
to $500/year which seems very reasonable.

I think it would be good to offer this to even the playing field with Houston 
based employees.

Thanks,
Shanna

Mike,

Attached is the proposed plan transfer to EGM for Enron Japan.  These amounts 
have been reviewed and approved by Joe Hirl.  We are still working with Enron 
Europe to gain agreement on the effective date (April 1 or July 1)  - will 
let you know as soon as this is settled.

Here's a summary of the Plan Amounts;

			 Split after 2Q 
			
			 EGM 
Margin*	1Q		                 -   
	2Q		                 -   
	3Q		      3,750,000 
	4Q		      3,750,000 
	2001		      7,500,000 
			
			
Expense	1Q		                 -   
	2Q		                 -   
	3Q		      3,366,377 
	4Q		      3,366,377 
	2001		      6,732,754 
			
			
EBIT	1Q		                 -   
	2Q		                 -   
	3Q		         383,623 
	4Q		         383,623 
	2001		         767,246 

If we end up with an April 1 transfer, EGM will be kept whole on plan (will 
be approx $3.4 MM expense, zero margin).

Please advise if you have any questions or wish to discuss this in further 
detail.

Pelt,

Howdy from Houston.  I hope you had a great Thanksgiving.  I took the week
off and it was what i needed.  I have been working at a hectic pace and was
on my annual sick rotation, although a little earlier than normal.  I
needed the break.  My international traveling is over for the year, thank
God.

Chris and i were talking about life and vacations and spring break came up.
I thought i would send you our information and see if our breaks
co-ordinated and to see if we still wanted to try and get together to go
skiing.  We didn't know if you made other plans or moved on since our last
discussion a while ago.  Our spring break is March 12-16th .

Please let give an update via email when you get a chance.  I figured that
you are in Telluride right now on holiday.

Give my love to all.

Mike



PS - How about those Sooners!  OU/TX wasn't a fluke. Hard to believe, we'll
see what will happen with K State and bowls.  No matter, its been a fun
year.  It is nice to be back.

",True

1289520.0,"A friend of mine, formerly with Bankers Trust, called to see if we are 
interested in hearing a story about a floating LNG facility. He is with 
Merlin Production, a small producer, that thinks there is a large market for 
accessing stranded gas in offshore fields.  If you have an interest let me 
know and I'll arrange a meeting. I owe this guy nothing other that a call 
back so if you have no interest say so. Rick
",False
59940.0,"Just to give you an example of the requests that came up one day last week 
within Enron directed to me.

1) The Panama office (EGE-MINSA) called with budget help and need forward 
Panama Parity prices for Bunker C and MDO for the next 15 months. There is no 
forward Panama Parity market, but we have been able to produce a forward 
curve by updating the historical PP prices. This process helps the Panama 
City office be able to deal with the local regulators and get dispatched 
more. 
2) Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico called and needed historical NYMEX NX3 natural 
gas prices back to 1993 due to a dispute with their power purchaser because 
their contract is poorly written. Knowledge of these numbers will help them 
make a better case with their customer. 
3) The Buenos Aires office called and needed help with their EOL rollout and 
hedge prices tied to NYMEX crude for a crude producer in Argentina.
4) The Guatemala office (PQPC) called with a sulfur issue on the latest cargo 
delivery. This lead to numerous discussions with the independent inspectors 
and fuel supplier. The issue is of particular importance at PQPC because of 
the recent financing of the project and the scrutiny regarding the emissions 
at the plant. 
5) Mariella Mahan's group called looking for help on physical and financial 
resid into Nicaragua regarding their bid/negotiation with ENEL on the 
privatization of some power plants in Nicaragua. The plants currently buy 
from Esso and we hope to improve their fuel prices by up to a $1/barrel. That 
would create an annual savings of over $1.5MM per year. This involved a 
lengthy conference call, existing contract review and several forward curves.
6) The weather group was looking for historical propane prices for a new 
product to be offered to Conoco.
7) The San Paulo office called looking for a twenty year forward curve for 
crude and three grades of resid to help them with an LDC project them 
operate. 
8) The Metgas office in India called looking for a one year naphtha hedge 
tied to crude. 
9) ENA called to talk about using jet fuel instead of low sulfur diesel in a 
proposed peaker in Florida. I went through a cost/benefit analysis with them 
and they went back to using the LS diesel curve for the project. 
10) Rob Bradley called looking for help with the Enron Washington, DC office 
who was fighting off a challenge from the NYMEX who wants EOL regulated like 
an exchange. We were able to provide Chris Long numerical data that helped 
Enron's case and ultimately Enron got the initial ruling they were looking 
for. 

All of the above were in addition to our normal daily duties (battles) with 
the five EI power plants and their fuel deliveries, along with the new 
business ventures we are involved in. If you want specific big money savings 
for other Enron entities or projects I would refer you to the previous memos 
I have sent you regarding India, Guatemala and Panama which exceeded $20MM. 
Hopefully, the daily requests that we service for other Enron groups leads to 
better projects with better actual returns and less overall problems. 

If you need additional information I would be glad to provide it.

I am totally open to wherever you think would be best.  If possible, it would 
also be good if there were a few extra
spots for some people in the group to be together.  I am not sure yet how 
many people will be needed but I would like
to optimally have a small swat team to focus on each business.  

Thanks very much for the kind words.  I look forward to focusing
on the new businesses quickly and figuring out ways to add value.  I am very 
excited to be working with you again.  Talk to you soon.

The next issue of our newsletter is in the works, with a planned distribution 
set for late June. Mark Frevert has requested that the Executive Letter be 
rotated among the presidents of EWS. This is the inside cover message and 
should be 300+ words. I hope that you will be able to squeeze this into your 
busy schedule.

Here is a suggested outline.  If you want to fill in the outline with 
information, I will be happy to turn it into a letter for you.

 I.  An overview of EWS/EGM as we move forward.

 II. A short-term retrospective about EGM activities and successes

           III. Future plans/initiatives for EGM
     (strategic vision of the group, opportunities, expectations, etc.) 

Please feel free to modify as you see fit.  I have attached Greg Whalley's 
letter from our last issue to give you an idea of the format. Let me know if 
there is anything I can do to help you.  I need your letter by June 15, if 
possible.

 
Hope to hear from you soon.

Attached is the proposed plan transfer to EGM for Enron Japan.  These amounts 
have been reviewed and approved by Joe Hirl.  We are still working with Enron 
Europe to gain agreement on the effective date (April 1 or July 1)  - will 
let you know as soon as this is settled.

Here's a summary of the Plan Amounts;

			 Split after 2Q

	2001		         767,246 

If we end up with an April 1 transfer, EGM will be kept whole on plan (will 
be approx $3.4 MM expense, zero margin).

Please advise if you have any questions or wish to discuss this in further

Subject: Global LNG's Contacts with Japanese Trading Companies, Nissho Iwai 
in Particular

Joe:

Following up on my phone conversation with Morten Erik today and in advance 
of your meetings in Houston next week, I would like to brief you about Enron 
Global LNG's recent contacts with Japanese trading companies.

We have tabled master spot LNG SPAs, in both FOB and ex-ship form, with 
Mitsubishi, Nissho Iwai, Itochu and Mitsui with the objective to discuss, 
negotiate and conclude these contractual arrangements by late fall this year.

Nissho Iwai represents a special case, though.  In addition to our 
discussions on the master spot LNG purchase contracts, we had previously 
talked with NIC about possible access to some of the LNG shipping capacity 
they control.  Also, during my meeting with Nissho Iwai earlier this week, 
they showed keen interest in connecting with Enron Global LNG's team 
developing the U.S. West Coast terminal opportunities.  NIC, with some other 
Japanese partners, has apparently been trying to develop a specific site in 
California (offshore concept) for some time and is now looking for a 
suitable, strong U.S. partner.  There will be an exploratory meeting held on 
this issue in Houston between Kurt Lindahl and NIC representatives (both from 
Tokyo and New York) probably in early June.

Please let me know if you need more information on this subject.

Regards,

Zdenek Gerych

Some of our employees in NY have asked whether we would be offering the same 
Health Club reimbursement as what Enron Metals offers in NY.

Ultimately, it is a business cost, not an HR decision.  Metals reimburses up 
to $500/year which seems very reasonable.

I think it would be good to offer this to even the playing field with Houston 
based employees.

Thanks,
Shanna

",False
59940.0,"Just to give you an example of the requests that came up one day last week 
within Enron directed to me.

1) The Panama office (EGE-MINSA) called with budget help and need forward 
Panama Parity prices for Bunker C and MDO for the next 15 months. There is no 
forward Panama Parity market, but we have been able to produce a forward 
curve by updating the historical PP prices. This process helps the Panama 
City office be able to deal with the local regulators and get dispatched 
more. 
2) Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico called and needed historical NYMEX NX3 natural 
gas prices back to 1993 due to a dispute with their power purchaser because 
their contract is poorly written. Knowledge of these numbers will help them 
make a better case with their customer. 
3) The Buenos Aires office called and needed help with their EOL rollout and 
hedge prices tied to NYMEX crude for a crude producer in Argentina.
4) The Guatemala office (PQPC) called with a sulfur issue on the latest cargo 
delivery. This lead to numerous discussions with the independent inspectors 
and fuel supplier. The issue is of particular importance at PQPC because of 
the recent financing of the project and the scrutiny regarding the emissions 
at the plant. 
5) Mariella Mahan's group called looking for help on physical and financial 
resid into Nicaragua regarding their bid/negotiation with ENEL on the 
privatization of some power plants in Nicaragua. The plants currently buy 
from Esso and we hope to improve their fuel prices by up to a $1/barrel. That 
would create an annual savings of over $1.5MM per year. This involved a 
lengthy conference call, existing contract review and several forward curves.
6) The weather group was looking for historical propane prices for a new 
product to be offered to Conoco.
7) The San Paulo office called looking for a twenty year forward curve for 
crude and three grades of resid to help them with an LDC project them 
operate. 
8) The Metgas office in India called looking for a one year naphtha hedge 
tied to crude. 
9) ENA called to talk about using jet fuel instead of low sulfur diesel in a 
proposed peaker in Florida. I went through a cost/benefit analysis with them 
and they went back to using the LS diesel curve for the project. 
10) Rob Bradley called looking for help with the Enron Washington, DC office 
who was fighting off a challenge from the NYMEX who wants EOL regulated like 
an exchange. We were able to provide Chris Long numerical data that helped 
Enron's case and ultimately Enron got the initial ruling they were looking 
for. 

All of the above were in addition to our normal daily duties (battles) with 
the five EI power plants and their fuel deliveries, along with the new 
business ventures we are involved in. If you want specific big money savings 
for other Enron entities or projects I would refer you to the previous memos 
I have sent you regarding India, Guatemala and Panama which exceeded $20MM. 
Hopefully, the daily requests that we service for other Enron groups leads to 
better projects with better actual returns and less overall problems. 

If you need additional information I would be glad to provide it.

I am totally open to wherever you think would be best.  If possible, it would 
also be good if there were a few extra
spots for some people in the group to be together.  I am not sure yet how 
many people will be needed but I would like
to optimally have a small swat team to focus on each business.  

Thanks very much for the kind words.  I look forward to focusing
on the new businesses quickly and figuring out ways to add value.  I am very 
excited to be working with you again.  Talk to you soon.

Some of our employees in NY have asked whether we would be offering the same 
Health Club reimbursement as what Enron Metals offers in NY.

Ultimately, it is a business cost, not an HR decision.  Metals reimburses up 
to $500/year which seems very reasonable.

I think it would be good to offer this to even the playing field with Houston 
based employees.

The next issue of our newsletter is in the works, with a planned distribution 
set for late June. Mark Frevert has requested that the Executive Letter be 
rotated among the presidents of EWS. This is the inside cover message and 
should be 300+ words. I hope that you will be able to squeeze this into your 
busy schedule.

Here is a suggested outline.  If you want to fill in the outline with 
information, I will be happy to turn it into a letter for you.

 I.  An overview of EWS/EGM as we move forward.

 II. A short-term retrospective about EGM activities and successes

           III. Future plans/initiatives for EGM
     (strategic vision of the group, opportunities, expectations, etc.) 

Please feel free to modify as you see fit.  I have attached Greg Whalley's 
letter from our last issue to give you an idea of the format. Let me know if 
there is anything I can do to help you.  I need your letter by June 15, if 
possible.

 
Hope to hear from you soon.

Attached is the proposed plan transfer to EGM for Enron Japan.  These amounts 
have been reviewed and approved by Joe Hirl.  We are still working with Enron 
Europe to gain agreement on the effective date (April 1 or July 1)  - will 
let you know as soon as this is settled.

Here's a summary of the Plan Amounts;

			 Split after 2Q

	4Q		         383,623 
	2001		         767,246 

If we end up with an April 1 transfer, EGM will be kept whole on plan (will 
be approx $3.4 MM expense, zero margin).

Please advise if you have any questions or wish to discuss this in further 
detail.

",False
59940.0,"Just to give you an example of the requests that came up one day last week 
within Enron directed to me.

1) The Panama office (EGE-MINSA) called with budget help and need forward 
Panama Parity prices for Bunker C and MDO for the next 15 months. There is no 
forward Panama Parity market, but we have been able to produce a forward 
curve by updating the historical PP prices. This process helps the Panama 
City office be able to deal with the local regulators and get dispatched 
more. 
2) Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico called and needed historical NYMEX NX3 natural 
gas prices back to 1993 due to a dispute with their power purchaser because 
their contract is poorly written. Knowledge of these numbers will help them 
make a better case with their customer. 
3) The Buenos Aires office called and needed help with their EOL rollout and 
hedge prices tied to NYMEX crude for a crude producer in Argentina.
4) The Guatemala office (PQPC) called with a sulfur issue on the latest cargo 
delivery. This lead to numerous discussions with the independent inspectors 
and fuel supplier. The issue is of particular importance at PQPC because of 
the recent financing of the project and the scrutiny regarding the emissions 
at the plant. 
5) Mariella Mahan's group called looking for help on physical and financial 
resid into Nicaragua regarding their bid/negotiation with ENEL on the 
privatization of some power plants in Nicaragua. The plants currently buy 
from Esso and we hope to improve their fuel prices by up to a $1/barrel. That 
would create an annual savings of over $1.5MM per year. This involved a 
lengthy conference call, existing contract review and several forward curves.
6) The weather group was looking for historical propane prices for a new 
product to be offered to Conoco.
7) The San Paulo office called looking for a twenty year forward curve for 
crude and three grades of resid to help them with an LDC project them 
operate. 
8) The Metgas office in India called looking for a one year naphtha hedge 
tied to crude. 
9) ENA called to talk about using jet fuel instead of low sulfur diesel in a 
proposed peaker in Florida. I went through a cost/benefit analysis with them 
and they went back to using the LS diesel curve for the project. 
10) Rob Bradley called looking for help with the Enron Washington, DC office 
who was fighting off a challenge from the NYMEX who wants EOL regulated like 
an exchange. We were able to provide Chris Long numerical data that helped 
Enron's case and ultimately Enron got the initial ruling they were looking 
for. 

All of the above were in addition to our normal daily duties (battles) with 
the five EI power plants and their fuel deliveries, along with the new 
business ventures we are involved in. If you want specific big money savings 
for other Enron entities or projects I would refer you to the previous memos 
I have sent you regarding India, Guatemala and Panama which exceeded $20MM. 
Hopefully, the daily requests that we service for other Enron groups leads to 
better projects with better actual returns and less overall problems. 

If you need additional information I would be glad to provide it.

Subject: Windows 2000 Migration for the RM-Finance and Administration 
Business Unit

I wanted to take a few minutes to not only introduce myself, but also to 
inform you that ProjectGEM - the Windows2000 Global Enron Migration - is well 
underway and is now approaching your group to begin the initial steps of 
upgrading to this newer operating system. 
Currently Jeff Gossett is our pilot for this business unit and is testing out 
all applications associated with your business unit.  We expect to migrate 
Finance and Administration Wednesday or Thursday of next week (4/4 - 4/5)
As a former member of T.S.G. (TradeFloor Support Group - EB31/32) - I'm well 
aware of the time constraints and schedules you all must work with. 
Therefore, I would like to start the migration process first with visiting 
with each of you, going thru a 'profile process' that should last no more 
than 10-15min. Profiling can begin as early as today- so here is what I ask 
of you: 
*** Please reply to this e-mail with your current location, the number of 
PC's you have and the number of screens/displays you have attached to each 
PC, as well a date/time that I can stop by. Being that most of you sit in the 
same, general location - I'm hoping this profiling process should take no 
more than a few days. *** 
Feel free to e-mail/call me should you have any questions or any specific 
concerns with this process, as we strive to ensure the migration from WinNT 
to Win2K is a smooth, efficient one.
